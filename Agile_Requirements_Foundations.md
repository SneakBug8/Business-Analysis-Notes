## Agile Requirements Foundations  

### Agile and the Business Analyst  
#### The Business Analyst role in Agile  
- facilitating dialogue about customer value with the team  
- making the product owner's decisions more efficient  
- analyzing for gaps and impacts  
- ensuring what is built is valuable  
- recognise and protect value throughout the life of a project  
- facilitate value driven decision making and priority setting  
- analyse product owner priorities and decompose them into small pieces  
- partner closely with the product owner to determine what's valuable by analyzing, facilitating dialogue, and getting the right information  
- facilitate shared understanding among a diverse group and identify those increments of value  
- Agile BA is about getting the right conversations happening so the team has a shared understanding of what they're building  
- Agile documentation serves the team as a conversation igniter, or a memory of a conversation  
- use high impact collaboration and communication techniques, rather than using documents to define the process  
- work partially on supporting the work currently in progress, and partially on preparing for future work to be done  

#### The Agile Manifesto from a Buiness Analyst perspective  
The Agile Manifesto is made up of four values and 12 principles that Agile teams strive to truly be agile.  

Four Values of Agile:  

**Individuals and interactions over processes and tools**.  
- focus on face-to-face conversations over following a specified process  
- use high-impact collaboration techniques to elicit and analyze requirements  

**working software over comprehensive documentation**.  
- focus on getting feedback associated with the actual software rather than feedback on a document  
- requirements will evolve faster and more accurately when our customers and users get their eyes and hands on working software  

**customer collaboration over contract negotiation**.  
- understanding, as a team, that contracts and agreements need to flexible given our ever-changing environments  
- focus on collaborating rather than requirements documents and contracts  
- shared understanding through dialog will result in better products over a focus on creating a document as the process for requirements  

**responding to change over following a plan**.  
- plan in value increments instead of big, task-based Gantt charts  
- plan based on outcomes rather than schedule and tests  
- a detailed plan is not needed to keep track of such a small scope but details of what's valuable is needed  
- plan longer-term - plan with a vision, a product roadmap, and release plans  
-  all about the value dimensions of what's being delivered, keeping the team focused on what's valuable  
- Agile tracking calls for transparency that often exposes rough spots for the team that may have been easily hidden before  
- fight to keep work in progress small, so we can respond quickly when priorities change  
- continuous improvement is important  

#### Agile Principles 1-4 from a Buiness Analyst perspective  

1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.  
- BAs facilitate the dialogue that helps the product owner prioritise what the team builds  
- BBAs support continuous delivery by facilitating the breaking down of functionality into small pieces of value (No one else provides this perspective - Business leaders see large chunks of functionality and the technical team focuses on technical components and technical layers)  
- advocate for the users and customers by identifying small increments of value that users can see and experience  

2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.  
- facilitate the team in discovering emerging thoughts and ideas that will make the product more valuable  
- external market changes and feedback from customers continuously influence the product and BAs help incorporate this feedback into the product backlog and priorities  
- changing requirements mean the product is getting better than previously imagined  

3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.  
- BAs are key to helping customers and business leaders realise the intended benefits of a product sooner  
- BAs slice work into small increments of value and help the team analyse business value, technical dependencies, and technical debt  
- BAs are a critical player in facilitating the needed dialogue on the team to not only ensure the software works but that it's also valuable  

4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.  
- BAs are engaged and available to the team on a daily basis. They facilitate continuous conversations throughout the day using high impact collaboration and communication that results in rapid learning and fast decision making  
- requirements and documentation are kept lightweight. The focus is on dialogue rather than cranking up documents  

#### Agile Principles 5-8 from a Buiness Analyst perspective  

5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.  
- BAs serve the user, customer, and the organisation. They help the team understand each piece of work and how it aligns to the vision  
- help the product owner prioritise, make decisions, balance trade-offs, and remove features or work that doesn't align with the product vision  
- On agile teams, BAs are empowered to be part of this by facilitating collaborative requirements, techniques that invoke deep conversations  

6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.  
- On agile teams, BAs don't hand off requirements and stories to developers. Requirements are based on conversations. Documents or details typed into a tool are placeholders for conversation or memories of conversations. The team collaborates on a daily basis to understand stories and features  
- The BA uses conversations, facilitated sessions, and structured dialogue to keep the team engaged  
- virtual teams can also use many tools to facilitate face-to-face dialogue as well. Tools that use virtual whiteboards, virtual sticky notes and video are common for virtual agile teams  

7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.  
- We want the product owner, business analyst, and some user representatives to see working software as often as possible during the sprint or iteration  
- The BA demonstrates this principle via prioritised stories, well-defined acceptance criteria, prototyping and experimenting. BAs elicit feedback from users as the sprint progresses  

8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.  
- BAs work on requirements just in time. This is not reactive work but actually proactive. BAs work with the product owner to understand the product vision and roadmap  
- The BA helps the product owner refine the backlog in the big picture view as well as the detailed views - the detailed views are only needed for the upcoming work items and BAs also help the teams slice and estimate work  
- When the backlog is well refined, the planning and execution of an iteration flows smoothly and maintains a steady manageable pace  

#### Agile Principles 9-12 from a Buiness Analyst perspective  

9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.  
- BAs work with the development team to understand technical risks, architecture, and technical debt  
- The BA boosts technical excellence by helping the development team understand the product vision and roadmap. In turn, the development team helps the BA and product owner with prioritisation, by communicating technical risks and helping the team understand how decisions impact value to the customer  

10. Simplicity - the art of maximising the amount of work not done - is essential.  
- BAs ensure that many backlog items actually never get done. Why? Because the BA and product owner are working together to make sure only the most important things get done  - - They evaluate backlog items to make sure they align with the vision and the future. BAs refine the backlog to shift the team's focus to the highest priority items  
- BAs need to have a ruthless focus on value and analyse items submitted to the backlog for their contribution to value  
- This principle also applies to the work of BAs in terms of what gets documented. Lightweight documentation and models are key parts of the principles for BAs - only do enough work to meet the purpose and add value to the team  

11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.  
- The BA has a big part in prioritising what the team works on. To do this well, BAs must identify and act on changing requirements  
- Requirements emerge and evolve as the team learns. Architectures, requirements, and designs change and these changes cannot be predicted - the team needs to work hard to discover them from building, experimenting, and getting feedback  

12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behaviour accordingly.  
- BAs participate in the team's retrospectives. Frequent retrospectives drive continuous improvement and change the way the team works, to maximise value to the users and the organisation  
- As BAs, it also helps to look at our own work and retrospect with ourselves on what went well and what we can do to improve things for the next iteration@  
- Did we, as a team, engage in deep dialog and discovery of requirements?  
- Did I do lightweight modeling and did it help the dialogue with the team?  
- Was I focused on value to the customer?

### Agile Point of View  
#### The Business Analyst point of view on the Agile team  
Agile can look quite different if you come from a background where traditional software methodologies have been the rule for a long time, and document-driven governance has been the norm.  
Three points of view to keep in mind:  
**1. Customer Delight:**  
'Will the end customer be delighted by this product?'  
- Helps us to see the connection between our work and the end customer and guage if we are working on the right things  
- Even if you're working on something quite technical in nature, make the customer experience visible and understood by the team. It will give them the context they need to make good decisions  

**2. Flexibility:**  
- The role of BA has a lot less definition and boundaries than agile - what's important is that everything you do contributes value to the team, the organisation, and the customer - even if it means stepping outside your normal role and comfort zone  

**3. Learning and Discovery Process:**  
- Requirements today can be out of date within days of eliciting them, so we need to expect change and look for it. This is why agile principles encourage us to work on a small amount at one time and develop requirements just in time  
- It's wasteful to go back and rework requirements and even more wasteful to actually develop and deliver requirements that are outdated and that no longer matter
