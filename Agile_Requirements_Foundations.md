## Agile Requirements Foundations  

### Agile and the Business Analyst  
#### The Business Analyst role in Agile  
- facilitating dialogue about customer value with the team  
- making the product owner's decisions more efficient  
- analyzing for gaps and impacts  
- ensuring what is built is valuable  
- recognise and protect value throughout the life of a project  
- facilitate value driven decision making and priority setting  
- analyse product owner priorities and decompose them into small pieces  
- partner closely with the product owner to determine what's valuable by analyzing, facilitating dialogue, and getting the right information  
- facilitate shared understanding among a diverse group and identify those increments of value  
- Agile BA is about getting the right conversations happening so the team has a shared understanding of what they're building  
- Agile documentation serves the team as a conversation igniter, or a memory of a conversation  
- use high impact collaboration and communication techniques, rather than using documents to define the process  
- work partially on supporting the work currently in progress, and partially on preparing for future work to be done  

#### The Agile Manifesto from a Buiness Analyst perspective  
The Agile Manifesto is made up of four values and 12 principles that Agile teams strive to truly be agile.  

First of the four values is: **Individuals and interactions over processes and tools**.  
- focus on face-to-face conversations over following a specified process  
- use high-impact collaboration techniques to elicit and analyze requirements  

Next, **working software over comprehensive documentation**.  
- focus on getting feedback associated with the actual software rather than feedback on a document  
- requirements will evolve faster and more accurately when our customers and users get their eyes and hands on working software  

Third, **customer collaboration over contract negotiation**.  
- understanding, as a team, that contracts and agreements need to flexible given our ever-changing environments  
- focus on collaborating rather than requirements documents and contracts  
- shared understanding through dialog will result in better products over a focus on creating a document as the process for requirements  

Last, **responding to change over following a plan**.  
- plan in value increments instead of big, task-based Gantt charts  
- plan based on outcomes rather than schedule and tests  
- a detailed plan is not needed to keep track of such a small scope but details of what's valuable is needed  
- plan longer-term - plan with a vision, a product roadmap, and release plans  
-  all about the value dimensions of what's being delivered, keeping the team focused on what's valuable  
- Agile tracking calls for transparency that often exposes rough spots for the team that may have been easily hidden before  
- fight to keep work in progress small, so we can respond quickly when priorities change  
- continuous improvement is important
