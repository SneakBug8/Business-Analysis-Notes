## Agile Requirements Foundations  

### Agile and the Business Analyst  
#### The Business Analyst role in Agile  
- facilitating dialogue about customer value with the team  
- making the product owner's decisions more efficient  
- analyzing for gaps and impacts  
- ensuring what is built is valuable  
- recognise and protect value throughout the life of a project  
- facilitate value driven decision making and priority setting  
- analyse product owner priorities and decompose them into small pieces  
- partner closely with the product owner to determine what's valuable by analyzing, facilitating dialogue, and getting the right information  
- facilitate shared understanding among a diverse group and identify those increments of value  
- Agile BA is about getting the right conversations happening so the team has a shared understanding of what they're building  
- Agile documentation serves the team as a conversation igniter, or a memory of a conversation  
- use high impact collaboration and communication techniques, rather than using documents to define the process  
- work partially on supporting the work currently in progress, and partially on preparing for future work to be done  

#### The Agile Manifesto from a Buiness Analyst perspective  
The Agile Manifesto is made up of four values and 12 principles that Agile teams strive to truly be agile.  

Four Values of Agile:  

**Individuals and interactions over processes and tools**.  
- focus on face-to-face conversations over following a specified process  
- use high-impact collaboration techniques to elicit and analyze requirements  

**working software over comprehensive documentation**.  
- focus on getting feedback associated with the actual software rather than feedback on a document  
- requirements will evolve faster and more accurately when our customers and users get their eyes and hands on working software  

**customer collaboration over contract negotiation**.  
- understanding, as a team, that contracts and agreements need to flexible given our ever-changing environments  
- focus on collaborating rather than requirements documents and contracts  
- shared understanding through dialog will result in better products over a focus on creating a document as the process for requirements  

**responding to change over following a plan**.  
- plan in value increments instead of big, task-based Gantt charts  
- plan based on outcomes rather than schedule and tests  
- a detailed plan is not needed to keep track of such a small scope but details of what's valuable is needed  
- plan longer-term - plan with a vision, a product roadmap, and release plans  
-  all about the value dimensions of what's being delivered, keeping the team focused on what's valuable  
- Agile tracking calls for transparency that often exposes rough spots for the team that may have been easily hidden before  
- fight to keep work in progress small, so we can respond quickly when priorities change  
- continuous improvement is important  

#### Agile Principles 1-4 from a Buiness Analyst perspective  

1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.  
- BAs facilitate the dialogue that helps the product owner prioritise what the team builds  
- BBAs support continuous delivery by facilitating the breaking down of functionality into small pieces of value (No one else provides this perspective - Business leaders see large chunks of functionality and the technical team focuses on technical components and technical layers)  
- advocate for the users and customers by identifying small increments of value that users can see and experience  

2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.  
- facilitate the team in discovering emerging thoughts and ideas that will make the product more valuable  
- external market changes and feedback from customers continuously influence the product and BAs help incorporate this feedback into the product backlog and priorities  
- changing requirements mean the product is getting better than previously imagined  

3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.  
- BAs are key to helping customers and business leaders realise the intended benefits of a product sooner  
- BAs slice work into small increments of value and help the team analyse business value, technical dependencies, and technical debt  
- BAs are a critical player in facilitating the needed dialogue on the team to not only ensure the software works but that it's also valuable  

4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.  
- BAs are engaged and available to the team on a daily basis. They facilitate continuous conversations throughout the day using high impact collaboration and communication that results in rapid learning and fast decision making  
- requirements and documentation are kept lightweight. The focus is on dialogue rather than cranking up documents  

#### Agile Principles 5-8 from a Buiness Analyst perspective  

5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.  

6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.  

7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.  

8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.  

#### Agile Principles 9-12 from a Buiness Analyst perspective  

9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.  

10. Simplicity - the art of maximising the amount of work not done - is essential.  

11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.  

12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
