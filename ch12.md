## Modelling Requirements:  
UML - Unified Modeling Language
### Modelling Business Use Cases:  
Use case diagrams represent things that an organisation, business system or IT system need to provide.  
Business use case diagrams show the usage that stakeholders require of a system.  
These are useful when scoping a project or working out areas to be analyse and investigated.  

### Modelling System Use Cases:  
A model drawn using defined notational standards is rarely ambiguous.  
Depicts 'functions' that will be provided and 'actors' who are involved in using those functions.  

**Actors**  
Whoever or whatever expects a service from a system.  
Usually user roles but may also be external systems.  
Actors are usually represented by matchstick men (or a rectangle with an actor)  


**Associations**  
**The <<include>> and <<extend>> constructs**
