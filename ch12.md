# Modelling Requirements  

## 12.1 Modelling System Functions:  

UML - Unified Modeling Language
### Modelling Business Use Cases:  
Use case diagrams represent things that an organisation, business system or IT system need to provide.  
Business use case diagrams show the usage that stakeholders require of a system.  
These are useful when scoping a project or working out areas to be analyse and investigated.  

### Modelling System Use Cases:  
A model drawn using defined notational standards is rarely ambiguous.  
Depicts 'functions' that will be provided and 'actors' who are involved in using those functions.  

**Actors**  
Whoever or whatever expects a service from a system.  
Usually user roles but may also be external systems.  
Actors are usually represented by matchstick men (or a rectangle with an actor)  

Each use case is shown in an oval and represents a function that the system will perform in response to a trigger (verb noun convention is used - set up room)  
System boundary is indicated by a large box drawn around all of the use cases with the actors outside.  

**Associations**  
Lines are drawn linking actors with their appropriate cases.  
Use case diagrams are particularly useful during a workshop because they are so easily understood by business users and provide an excellent framework for the discussion.  
Use case descriptions list the steps that take place during the interaction.  

**The include and extend constructs**  
Some processing elements are repeated. To avoid repeating steps the include is shown on a dotted line pointing to the included use case.  

During mor detaile dinvestigation it may emerge that some elements are not manadatory (not must haves) and so a separate use case can be created to extend the original use case.  

## 12.2 Modelling System Data:  

Data to be stored in the IT system must be modelled. This allows users of the system to agree the data that will be recorded and retrieved.  

### Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs):  
An entity is something that the enterprise recognises in the area under investigation and wishes to collect and store data about. It might be:  
Physical (orders, customers, suppliers)  
Conceptual (booking, appointment)  
Active (meeting, course)  

**Attributes**  
Entities are described by attributes (book = title, author, publisher, price)  

**Relationships**  
A relationship is a relevant business connection between two entities.

### Types of Relationships:  

**One-to-many Relationships**  
Employee allocated to one office but each office must have multiple employees.  

**One-to-one Relationships**  
The relationship between two entities is exactly one-to-one.  
An order is related to one invoice and one invoice is related to one order.  

**Optionality**  
The optionality of the relationship describes whether or not the entities at both ends of the relationship must always coexist or whether one entity can exist without the other entity.  
Where there is not optionality and both entities must always co-exist, the relationship is drawn using a solid line.  
The complete opposite of a fully mandatory relationship occurs where a relationship is fully optional. This means that both entities can exist completely independently of each other and the relationship uses a dotted line.  

**Many-to-many Relationships**  
One employee may be contracted to work on one or many projects and a project may have one or many employed contracted to it.  
Usually resolved with a separate entity to join the two (Employees and Projects joined by a Contract)  

**Relationship Names**  
Relationship link phrases are constructed from the perspective of each entity (each sales region *responsible for* one or more customers/each customer must be *allocated to* one sales region)  

**Exclusive Relationships**  
In an exclusive relationship, the participation of an entity occurrence in one relationship precludes it from participating in another.  
The exclusive relationship may extend to more than two alternatives. For example, if the Employee could be allocated to a Sales region, Office or Data centre, there would be three entities related to Employee and the exclusive arc would extend across all three relationships.  

### Class Models:  
Shows graphically the classes in a system and their associations with each other.  
Class models capture information about the particular things involved in the org's operations (projects, customers, team members)  

**Objects**  
Something we wish to hold data about because that data is needed within the system we are analysing.  
Objects are sent messages that invoke them to respond in some way (a message sent to an order number might change the date the order was fulfilled)  

**Classes**  
To build a model of the system data we consider classes of objects rather than individual objects.  
Classes that provide the generic definition of the data items or attributes, and objects that are the instances of a particular class.  

A class, therefore, is a template for its object instances in the same way that an entity type is the template for its entity occurrences.  
Every object is an instance of some class that defines the common set of features (attributes and operations) that are shared by all objects in that class.  

**Associations**  
Connections between classes.  
The class model reflects the business rules that will govern the classes and the operations performed upon them. Multiplicity is used to show the business rules for an association between classes.  

**Generalisation and inheritance**  

### Modelling in Agile Approaches:  
```
It is sometimes thought that models are not used in projects that follow the Agile approach
because, in these projects, there is not the need to fully define the system ‘up front’. Indeed, the
Agile Manifesto stated that working software is valued over comprehensive documentation.
However, the Manifesto does not say that there is no value in documentation, only that working
software is more valuable. It is our view that, even in an Agile project, models can be useful to
help the user community understand the scope and scale of the proposed system before detailed
development commences. In addition, once the system is delivered, there is the question of
ongoing maintenance to consider and models can be invaluable to the maintenance team, as
described in the next section.
```  

### The Use of Modelling in System Maintenance:  
70% of expenditure of the lifetime cost of an IT system is incurred after it is implemented. Because errors are discovered in the software that have to be fixed and users require changes.  
Models can help prevent the reason for a system being built a certain way being lost in the msits of time.
