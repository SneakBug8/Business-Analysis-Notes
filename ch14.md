- Alignment:  
Ensuring the org's objectives and strategy are aligned with teh external business world.  
Any proposed changes are aligned with the internal policies and architectures.  

- Definition:  
Taking a closer look at the business situation to uncover root causes of problems, conduct a thorough analysis, recommend relevant, feasible changes and define requirements.  

- Design:  
Detailed specification, development and testing of the solution, including the business processes and related tasks (and the software that is needed to support them)  

- Implementation:  
Planning and preparation for the deployment of the business changes.  

- Realisation:  
The review of the predicted business benefits in order to identify those achieved and supporting those still to be realised.  

## 14.1 BA Role in the BCLC:  

- Design of the solution  
- Development and testing of the software to support the solution  

POPIT must be considered during this stage.  
Each element's impact on the other must be considered.  

- People:  
Skill development - new capability will mean skills of team members need to be subjected to GAP analysis.  

- Organisation:  
Structures, Measures, Jobs - revised processes often redefine or create new job roles.  

- Business Process Design:  
BAs are heavily involved with the design stage but are also involved in the implementation stage.  

- IT:  
BAs also have a role during the design, development and testing of the software solution.  

## 14.2 Design Stage:  

**Design**:  Ensure the requirements are understood and delivered, clarify what the software needs to do and support the design activity by clarifying points following consultation with the business users.  

**Development**:  
Help communicating between the business staff and supporting them making decisions about the detailed requirements. Assess impact of proposals, identify where there may be problems and suggest alternatives.  

**Testing**:  
Define the acceptance criteria. Support business staff during user acceptance testing:  
Use case descriptions ('main success scenario' (happy day) plus alternative scenarios)  
Decision tables (clearly set out the range of conditions for a particular situation and actions to be taken givena  specific set of conditions)  
State charts (show the different states a particular entity or class may take on during its lifetime in the system)  

## 14.3 Implementation Stage:  

- Emotional impact experienced by the business staff during this stage (failure to consider this may inflame resistence and undermine changes).  
**SARAH:**  
- Shock -> Lack of awareness of the needs for change  
- Anger -> What the change may mean to them, their roles, their status. Directed at managers, BAs, Devs  
- Rejection -> Avoid the change in order to keep normality  
- Acceptance -> Not necessarily wholehearted support but acceptance that it is happening    
- Hope -> Seeing the positive benefits brought about by the change  

## 14.4 Realisation Stage:  

Benefits will only be realised if they are well-defined, planned for and managed well.  
**Benefits Plan**:  
- Context/Vision -> sets out the background for the change project and provides a wider business context  
- Benfits profiles -> full descriptions of each of the benefits including the type and identified owner (identifier and name, owner, stakeholders involved or interested, measures and dependencies)  
- Benefits Dependency Network (Benefits Map) -> shows the enabling and actual changed required to deliver the business benefits. Dependencies between benefits and ultimate business objectives are also shown  
- Responsibilities -> benefit owners and their responsibilities  
- Tracking procedures -> how beneifts will be tracked and reported upon

### Managing the Business Case:  

Each time a request or change arises, it is import ant to review the business case to ensure that it is still valid.  

#### Benefits Reviews:  
 - Scheduled reviews:  
 At each of the decision gates the expected benefits should be examined (Are the expected benefits still available? Are they still sufficient to compensate for an increase in costs?)  
 
 - Unscheduled reviews:  
 Whenever a significant event occurs that could affect the benefits (Major requests for change. Change in key stakeholders. Developments in external business environments. Change to business strategy)  
 
#### Benefits Realisation Report:  
Asses whether the hoped-for benefits have been gained or not.
1. Where hoped-for benefits have not yet been achieved. Identify any aditional actions that could have been taken to achieve them.  
2. Reassure decision-makers that the time and effort for the project are justified.  
3. Input to future business cases and future projects to help make them more successful.  
4. Enable the org, over time, to increase the capapbility for choosing which projects to undertake.
