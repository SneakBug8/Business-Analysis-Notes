# Business Process Modeling  

A visual way to represent how an organisation performs work and services  

1. Capture processes  
2. Provide visual representation - who does what, and in what order  
3. Identify what's needed  

**Business models** represent *current* state, define *future* state, and identify *gaps*  

**Actor**  
A person, department, system, or external entity to the organisation  

**Benefits**  
1. Ensure understanding of how an org runs, performs, and relates to the outside world.  
2. Identify areas not well understood.  
3. Clarifies responsibilities across the whole process.  
4. Identify and break down complex business processes.  
5. Helps with training documentation.  
6. Captures interrelationships between people, processes, activities, and systems.  

### Most commonly used tools:  

##### Context Diagram  
The context diagram provides the high level framework and interaction of an org. The context diagram depicts the org as a circle. The external entities that connect to the area or system being analysed, represented by boxes. And lastly, the relationship of interactions between the org and the external entities are shown as the arrows. Our focus here are the interrelationships and activities that are either initiated or needed by the org.  

##### Functional Flow Diagram  
The functional flow diagram is a simple model showing the functional areas or stakeholders internally to our org and how they interact in a logical overall flow of work. The functional flow diagram always starts with a stakeholder, usually the customer or another entity external to the org, initiating a transaction. Stakeholders and internal functional areas are captured in the ovals. Then, the appropriate relationships and workflows are drawn between these stakeholder groups.  

##### Cross Functional Flow Diagram  
A way to capture and sequentially display the activities that are performed. Cross-functional flow diagrams also referred to as **activity diagrams**, and **swimlane diagrams**. The stakeholders also referred to as actors in the process. These diagrams organise activity sequences that displays the process in the context of the actors responsible for performing the work. This added structure makes it very easy to read and quickly identifies the individual actors work as well as cross-functional interactions needed. These diagrams are very effective in visually sharing a process is performed from start to finish, and what each and every stakeholder or actor needs to perform to enable completion of the activity.

##### Process Flow Charting  
These traditional process flow models show the sequential flow of activities, decision points, and other interactions. Process Flow models are used as a way to capture the step by step procedures and activities performed by an individual actor. These processes describe who and what has to be involved in fully responding to an event, or how people in the enterprise collaborate to achieve a goal. These process workflow models are the low level detail not represented in the cross functional swimlane models.

## UML and BPMN  
Internationally recognised modeling standards  

**UML** - Unified Modeling Language  
**BPMN** - Business Process Modeling Notation
