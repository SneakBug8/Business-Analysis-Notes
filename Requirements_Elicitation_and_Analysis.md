# Requirements Elicitation and Analysis:  

## Elicitation and Analysis Overview  

### What is Elicitation and Analysis?  

`Elicitation is the discover and progressive elaboration of understanding the needs of our stakeholders and customers.`  

Critical to understand if the solution we're working on is right for the stakeholders, customers, and the organization.  
Everyone has ideas - stakeholders, customers, users, developers. Elicitation and analysis finds the actual needs of the customers.  

**Elicitation** allows BAs to find out if they are working on solving a defect, understanding requirements for an enhancement request, or developing a new product, service, or process.  
It involves a set of techniques that goes beyond what's stated, beyond what the data says, and beyond everyone's ideas.  
The process helps the team evolve their ideas into requirements that will take a solution or product into alignment with what the customer needs, and serves the organization strategy.  

**Analysis** takes the information elicited, and looks at where the gaps and impacts are by breaking it down and looking at different angles.  
The angles you can examine are of a sequence, data, logical rules, the people involved, handoffs, and the various relationships that exist - how they all work together to achieve the goal of the product and improve the customer experience.  
Analysis involves a combination of thinking, inspiring dialog, and analysis with others. It involves modeling, diagramming, and documenting to bring out the various angles to ensure impact, gaps, scenarios, and connections are well understood by the team.  

### The Role of Elicitation and Analysis in Requirements  
True elicitation and analysis is more about dialog, shared understanding, visuals, and exploring.  

**Elicitation** is the discovery and evolution of thought for what you are building - learning together as a team what is the right thing to build for the customer.  
Many times, stakeholders are simply voicing what their needs are in the only way they know how to voice them at the time - a customer's stated requirements can actually vary greatly from the true need.  
Elicitation gives them the opportunity to evolve their thoughts, think out loud, and sit with their thoughts - to co-create their idea and solutions with you and the team.  

**Analysis** is analysing the information elicited and bringing back meaningful models, questions, conversation, and diagrams back to the team in order to elicit more.  
Using various techniques to break down, sum up, and organize the information into views that help you and the team.  

#### What to Analyse?  
- People who use the system and their interactions  
- Data, rules, and scenarios that drive user behaviour and needs  
- Others who amy be impacted  

Analysing from a user's point of view helps ensure that what gets built is actually satisfying the user's needs.  
Analysis allows us to firgure out what information we do have and what we don't so that we know what to ask.  

### Why is it Important?  
Most projects experience a large amount of rework and waste, things like defects, missed requirements, scope creep, over-engineered features, and frustrated users - due to a lack of elicitation and analysis.  
Rework is typically a result of moving forward to development without really knowing what the true needs and scope are.  
When doing great requirements work, we break down the request into the true need and functionality, understanding the data, people, process, rules, policies, and the various intricacies of what goes on behind the system.  

### The Relationship of Elicitation and Analysis  
Involves iterations and increments.  
Elicit to have something to analyse -> and analyse to know what more to elicit and determine what still needs to be discovered.  
Elicitation and analysis often happen at the same time, in the same meeting meaning some of the techniques used to elicit are also used to analyse.  
For example - asking questions in an interview leads to more questions and asking about a process leads to the completion of a process model.  

### Levels of Detail in Elicitation and Analysis  
Progressive elaboration = Layers:  
1st layer = problem or opportunity -> What problem will the project, product, enhancement, or defect solve? What opportunity will it help us take advantage of?  
Help the stakeholders understand why the solution is important and create a shared understanding of the team's purpose.  
2nd layer = user of the product/system/process and their goals -> who, what, why (role, goal, benefit)  
Understanding the goals the user has when using the product.  
3rd layer = peeling back each goal to uncover more details
Looking at details needed for each goal - data, rules, user interface, automation, interfaces with other systems etc.  
If levels are skipped then we are likely to end up solving the wrong problem.  

### Key Mindsets to be Successful  
Elicitation can sometimes feel like mindreading, therapy, facilitation, analysis all combined.  
- Keep focused on building the right thing for the customers, users and business - what they value may be different from what you or the team value.  
- Use collaboration skills to open stakeholder minds - stated requirements from stakeholders are almost never complete.  
- Get the team talking and drawing - visuals and conversations are much more effective than documents and text.  
- Use your unique perspective (the big picture AND the details) to help the business to make the right decisions about what they need and to help the dev teams to build it.  

## Elicitation Techniques  

### Elicitation Overview  
Projects are like icebergs and at the beginning we can only see the tip - we use elicitation techniques to help our stakeholders find the requirements, needs, risks, dependencies, assumptions, and opportunities that lie below the surface.  
Our stakeholders see the solution differently than engineers and developers do. We need to help them connect the dots by using high-impact collaboration techniques.  
Collaborative Elicitation:  
- planned and unplanned activities  
- vary techniques by level of formality  
- VARIETY (one technique is not enough)  
- do research to elicit (industry best practices for the process and technologies related to the subject domain)

### Interviews  
- Relationship building tool and deeper dive into the details of someone's domain or scope of work.  
- Value can be found in interviewing anyone involved in the project - sponsors, SMEs, business managers, customers and users.  
- Interviews should be strategic - helping to build or smooth relationships with key stakeholders or elicit details in areas of complexity.  
- Break each interview into three steps: 
**Prepare:**  
- Who are you interviewing?  
- What is their role and how can I make a personal connection with them?  
- What is my goal for the interview? (relationship building, understanding detailed information, thought provoking to evolve solution concepts?)  
- Engaging questions - to open up the dialogue  
- Probing questions - to elicit more detail  

**Conduct:**  
- Take the time to build rapport  
- Have 3-5 questions prepared for a 60 minute interview  
- Keep it converstaional and not rigid or structured  
- Create a framework of bullets (trying to take extensive notes can distract and wreck the flow)  

**Follow Up:**  
- Touch base after interview to make sure key points were captured correctly  
- Ask interviewee to clarify and validate a few important points (instead of giving them reams of notes to read)  
- Ask interviewee to review a visual model of your understanding of the details  

### Brainstorming  
- When done correctly it inspires creative thinking, new ideas, or a new approach to a problem.  
Things to brainstorm:  
- stakeholders who are impacted  
- features of a solution  
- solution options and alternatives  
- risks  
- ways to resolve issues  
- reactions and feelings that users might have when using a product  
- scenarios and exception paths  

Planning and good techniques are needed for effective brainstorming sessions:  
- Individual brainstorming - have a group silently think about their ideas  
- Group brainstorming  
- Flip charts, sticky notes - allows users to be active and anonymous when putting forward their ideas  

When done well brainstorming can boost group dynamics, generate powerful ideas, neutralize strong personalities, and elicit requirements quickly.  

### Observation (shadowing)  
- Not just watching people use the product but looking at how they go about the task, what problem they're trying to solve and the emotions that they have.  
- What thought processes are they using while using the product?  
- What tools are they using outside of the product or system?  
- What feelings does the user ahve while using the system?  
- When are they using additional knowledge? (from another system, their head)
- Is the system working as expected?  
- Be careful of changes in behaviour because the user knows they are being watched.  
- Be careful of the level of skill of the user you are observing - are they an average, super or struggling user?  
- Typically users do not use a product the way we would expect them to.  

Two types of observation:  
**Active:**  
- Working with the user - asking questions to understand and confirm the processes  
- Takes longer because of interruptions

**Passive:**  
- No interaction with user (sometimes they don't even know they are being observed)  
- What is frustrating for them? What is delighting them?  
- Takes less time  

### Experiments  
Sometimes people have blind spots due to complexity, ambiguity, or just plain uncertainty about the future.  
Experimenting is about learning the unknown, testing ideas, assumptions, and key theories that drive requirements for products and systems.  
Identify what you want to learn more about and design an experiment to bring the team the needed information.  
Experimenting helps teams get through the times when requirements are hard to get at or, on the other side of the equation, requirements keep changing.  

Plan an experiment:  
- What do we want to learn? (What information could we gather that would help the team make decisions?)  

Experiments are powerful and can get teams realtime information that shines a spotlight on the true needs and requirements of users.

### Workshops 
Strategically drawing out information from stakeholders and customers.  
High impact collaboration, deep dialogue, learning, exploring ideas and details.  
Inspire attendees to learn from each other.  

Plan a workshop:  
- Define your goal (What is the purpose of the workshop? What information do I need to elicit? How to make this valuable to the stakeholders that attend?)
- Determine who to invite (What will their role be? Who are the key stakeholders required to help me achieve my goal?)  
- Discuss roles and agenda with stakeholders before the workshop and help them understadn what's in it for them.  
- Design the workshop (engaging activities, games, small group work sessions, large group discussion)  
- Interactive, visual activities - brainstorming, sticky notes, group modeling and diagramming, collaborative games.  

BA Role:  
- Help draw out information needed to achieve your goal  
- Be a neutral facilitator  
- Support the process by prmoting diverent thinking first, and then helping the team converge to decisions.  
- Use the parking lot - a space to put information to revisit at a later time.  
- Keep the group focused on meeting the goal and not get distracted by subtopics.  
- Follow up and share valuable workshop artefacts with the team - keep it short - key items, key decisions, valuable models, lists, and diagrams.  

## Analysis Techniques  

### Analysis Overview  
Analysis involves discovering and connecting the big picture, the details and the value for users and their goals, data, rules and decisions, and gaps.  
Analysis helps us ensure complete and high quality requirements by helping stakeholders see and understand the same tree.  
Analysis identifies connections, gaps, impacts and questions that have not yet been discussed.  
Analysis involves a combination of thinking, dialogue, modeling, diagramming, and organising information in various views to help us think about and look at the product, process, or system from various perspectives.  

Analysis can be:  
- Solo or collaborative  
- Varied in formality - elaborate techniques with intricate steps or informal conversations.  
- VARIETY (one technique is not enough)  

### Process Models  
- Visual aid to explain a process or sequence of activities  
Used to:  
- Ignite dialogue on the team  
- See where the details fit into the big picture  
- Visualise the process  
- Organise requirements information  
- Analyse various detailed aspects of the system, product or process  

Keep it simple - stakeholders and the team must be able to read and understand the models intuitively (the dialogue should be about the process, not how to read it)  

Process Model Principles:  
- Know what you are modeling (current state? future state?)  
- Progressively elaborate and build in layers  
- Name the process and the activities in a verb-noun format (be specific and avoid vagues like handle, manage, process, coordinate)(select to checkout -> enter payment details -> confirm payment -> create account -> subscribe to newsletter)  

Use simple process models with details provided as supplements (decisions tables to include the logic within each step)  

### Context Diagrams  
Provide the solution's big picture by providing a view of the system or product in its environment, including the systems and people it interacts with - helps to identify scenarios, users, user goals, and external systems.  
A great representation of the intended scope at a summary level that can be used throughout the project.

Creating a context diagram:  
- Start with the name of your product in the centre (in a circle)  
- Add key people/roles -> customer, manager, order specialist, shipper, warehouse worker etc. (in a rectangle)  
- Add internal and external systems -> payment processors, internal data stores etc. (in a rectangle)  
- Explore the interactions between entities and goals using arrows and a phrase to describe  

<img src="https://d2slcw3kip6qmk.cloudfront.net/marketing/pages/chart/examples/contextdataflowdiagram.svg"><img>  

**Pro Tip:**  
- Do not connect user roles to each other or other rectangle entities (it is about interaction and data - not sequence)  
- Keep it to around 15 arrows (it is about the big picture - not close detail)  
- Try not to make this a technical architecture diagram of the technical components (it is a context model to help with user and business POV)  

### User Stories and Story Mapping  
User stories are placeholders for future conversations, and the story map shows a map of how the user stories relate to one another.  
User stories and story maps are a great technique many agile teams use, and they can also be used for non-agile projects as well as a powerful requirements technique.  

**User Stories:**  
WHO - WHAT - WHY (Role - Goal - Benefit)  
ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA - What is needed for the customer to describe the story as working  

Example: As an online shopper, I want to provide a credit card on file, so that I do not need to re-enter my credit card information each time I make a purchase.
WHO - online shopper  
WHAT - provide credit card on file  
WHY - so that information doesn't have to be re-entered  
ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA - option to save card details to account  

As the project evolves, it's quite common to discover user stories that are too big, because they include multiple pieces of functionality that need to be discussed, analyzed, and prioritized separately.  
**Story Splitting**  
Split from a user point of view (not a technical point of view)  
Splitting stories is important to analyse and prioritise what is important  

**Story Maps:**  
As user stories are created and split, a story map is a great way to analyze how all the stories fit together.  
Tells the whole story.  
To create a user story map, we take all of the user stories and place them in sequence of how a customer uses the product, from left to right. The vertical columns of the story map provide the details under the higher-level story or theme.  

<img src="https://www.myagilepartner.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/story-mapping-%E2%80%93-exemple-story-map-1.png"><img>  

Story mapping is a great way to discover gaps in requirements and analyze flow, data, and the user journey.  

### Decision Tables  
Decision Tables are a great way to organize and display decision logic.  
Ideally, we want the conditions to be binary, a Yes/No condition, and the ideal table has between two and four conditions. With these boundaries, the table stays small and manageable.  

To build a decision table, we start with defining the result or the decision to be made, in the last column.  
Next, we analyze the text based rules for the conditions that contribute to making the decision and add them as column headers on the table.  
Once you have the result and the conditions you can calculate how many possible scenarios there are:  
With a Y/N it's an exponent = 3 conditions with 2 options each -> 2^3 = 8 scenarios (this gives your rows)  
Now we are ready to determine the decisions of this logic and confirm them as a team, and this means completing the results column of the table.  

| Subscribed | Over £100 | Standard | Shipping cost |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Y | Y | Y | 0 |
| Y | Y | N | 20 |
| Y | N | N | 20 |
| N | N | N | 20 |
| N | Y | N | 0 |
| N | Y | Y | 0 |
| N | N | Y | 20 |
| Y | N | Y | 20 |

Using a decision table helps us pause to identify all of the scenarios, and puts the logic into an easy to read, discuss and review format.  
Developers and testers also love having this guide, to make sure their developing and testing the right scenarios and have clear results too.  

### Data Flow Diagrams  
Data flow analysis is a critical tool for generating high quality requirements. Without data flow analysis, customer satisfaction drops and defects rise. Users get frustrated when they don't see the data they expect, and are asked to reenter data they've already provided. Defects also increase when the data needed for automated decisions is not what it needs to be.  

A data flow diagram provides a great visual of the processes and the data that flows through them.  

**Creating a Data Flow Diagram:**  
- Place the processes along the top in circles  
- Identify the data stores that hold the data needed to support the processes and add those data stores to the bottom of the diagram in rectangles.  
- Next look at each circle or process and determine what chunks of data need to flow to and from the process to the customer, and the data stores.  

A critical step in any diagramming process is collaborating with others and walking the diagram together. Facilitate the walkthrough by asking them questions like, where do we store the decisions needed to calculate shipping? Or, what data do we need to transfer from the customer payment information database to the order database? Data flow diagrams show the inside of a system, and data flow is the primary focus.  

### State and Sequence Diagrams  
If status and timing are critical components of a solution, then state and sequence diagrams will boost the value of your requirements.  

**State Diagrams:**  
State diagrams show the different states something can take on (Order status - in cart, purchased, processing, shipped, delivered).  
Also shows what causes the state to change.  
Without understanding the states and how they change, your user experience will be compromised.   

**Sequence Diagrams:**  
Sequence diagrams show the interaction between people and different parts of a system.  
It shows the messages that get sent between the parties over time.  
Sequence diagrams help teams build a shared understanding of how various messages flow between people and systems and when responses are expected. This is important so that the team can see and discuss the interactions expected between various users and systems and when they work alone and together.  

Sequence diagrams can be at the business level or at a very technical level showing system-level messages. Be sure to model what's needed for your intended audience.  

## Tailoring to the Project or Product Type:  

### Blending Your Elicitation and Analysis Together  
Blending multiple techniques is the key to better results.  

We elicit to analyze and then the analysis brings out more questions that we need to research or elicit, and so on. This pattern repeats itself until we have enough information to move forward. But how do you know when you have enough?  

It's important when working with requirements to understand which pieces are the more valuable. What parts of a solution are most critical to the value the solution provides to the user?  

Elicitation and analysis are not phases of a project. Elicitation looks to discover information and analysis looks to find the areas where there is more to be discovered. It can be unconscious, which is happening when a conversation is taking place.  
Even if the solution is set from the beginning these analysis practices will yield powerful, unanticipated insights that will improve the quality of your solution.  

### New Processes, Products, and Systems  
Where to start?  
- Start by asking key stakeholders a few high impact questions (what does success look like? why are we looking for a solution?).  
- Ask stakeholders to describe their challenges with the current solution.  
- Try to understand if the challenges are related to why a new solution is being implemented.  
- Draw a **context diagram** to scope things out - it will help in identifying the various actors that would use the system, product or process.  
- Use a process model to map out the current and future state processes - to get an understanding from the team what's expected to change with the new solution.  

Keep the vision of a solution in mind to prevent the team from drifting into requirements that are not aligned with the solution.  

Keep in mind:  
- nonfunctional requirements  
- assumptions  
- constraints  
- data relationships  
- business rules  
- human-centered design  
- user experience  

The two biggest risks to this type of project are **lack of stakeholder involvement** and **lack of vision**. You need the right stakeholders involved to promote the vision. You also need stakeholders who are available to spend time with the team to protect the vision as the requirements are evolving.  

### Adding to a Process, Product, or System  
Most backlog items and requests that BAs work on are about adding to or modifying a solution.  
The trick is figuring out which of these many items are important and actually worth doing (over half of an average teams backlog should never get done - a lot of it is duplicate requests or just not important).  

Analyse the backlog to identify patterns. We analyse this by asking questions, such as:  
- Is each item helping us move forward or keeing us in the past?  
- Are there duplicates, conflicts, or many items related to a particular part of the solution?  
- Is the same issue being reported many times in different ways?  
- What are the root causes of the problems?  
- Which issues limit the value the users get from the solution?  

Use elicitation techniques to understand why it's important for the item to be completed.  
Many of these additions to solutions can start out the same way as a new system, using context to elicit and analyse where the change is impacting existing parts of a solution.  You never know what patterns or hidden connections you might find.  

### Buying and Implementing Software COTS (Commercial Off-The-Shelf)  
Four key differences to consider:  
1. Keep user goals front and centre  
Keep your requirements focused on the user and the activities they need to accomplish with the system (if it's already built you don't need to focus on the technical and functional details). What's important is making sure that the software allows the users to perform their necessary activities.  

2. Business rules and logic  
Understand the business rules, logic, policies, and decisions you're looking for the system to perform - make sure that the system allows you to configure and perform these rules with the needed data inputs. Typically in the configuration part of a system where you configure the inner rules of each step a user performs for an activity.  

3. Data definitions  
Consider how the purchased software defines and connects data. Prebuilt software has predefined data definitions, assumptions, and relationships. And in many cases, these differ from the buyer's data definitions, assumptions, and relationships. It's important to identify and understand these differences before implementation.  

4. Integrations  
Integrations are critical to most purchased software as organisations want systems to exchange data to and from the purchased software. It's important to define the business purpose of each integration, the process it supports, and the user impact with and without the integration. The details typically include defining the data needed between the systems and the detailed data attributes.
