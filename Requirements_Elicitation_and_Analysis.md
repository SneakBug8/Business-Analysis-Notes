# Requirements Elicitation and Analysis:  

## Elicitation and Analysis Overview  

### What is Elicitation and Analysis?  

`Elicitation is the discover and progressive elaboration of understanding the needs of our stakeholders and customers.`  

Critical to understand if the solution we're working on is right for the stakeholders, customers, and the organization.  
Everyone has ideas - stakeholders, customers, users, developers. Elicitation and analysis finds the actual needs of the customers.  

**Elicitation** allows BAs to find out if they are working on solving a defect, understanding requirements for an enhancement request, or developing a new product, service, or process.  
It involves a set of techniques that goes beyond what's stated, beyond what the data says, and beyond everyone's ideas.  
The process helps the team evolve their ideas into requirements that will take a solution or product into alignment with what the customer needs, and serves the organization strategy.  

**Analysis** takes the information elicited, and looks at where the gaps and impacts are by breaking it down and looking at different angles.  
The angles you can examine are of a sequence, data, logical rules, the people involved, handoffs, and the various relationships that exist - how they all work together to achieve the goal of the product and improve the customer experience.  
Analysis involves a combination of thinking, inspiring dialog, and analysis with others. It involves modeling, diagramming, and documenting to bring out the various angles to ensure impact, gaps, scenarios, and connections are well understood by the team.  

### The Role of Elicitation and Analysis in Requirements  
True elicitation and analysis is more about dialog, shared understanding, visuals, and exploring.  

**Elicitation** is the discovery and evolution of thought for what you are building - learning together as a team what is the right thing to build for the customer.  
Many times, stakeholders are simply voicing what their needs are in the only way they know how to voice them at the time - a customer's stated requirements can actually vary greatly from the true need.  
Elicitation gives them the opportunity to evolve their thoughts, think out loud, and sit with their thoughts - to co-create their idea and solutions with you and the team.  

**Analysis** is analysing the information elicited and bringing back meaningful models, questions, conversation, and diagrams back to the team in order to elicit more.  
Using various techniques to break down, sum up, and organize the information into views that help you and the team.  

#### What to Analyse?  
- Poeple who use the system and their interactions  
- Data, rules, and scenarios that drive user behaviour and needs  
- Others who amy be impacted  

Analysing from a user's point of view helps ensure that what gets built is actually satisfying the user's needs.  
Analysis allows us to firgure out what information we do have and what we don't so that we know what to ask.  

### Why is it Important?  
Most projects experience a large amount of rework and waste, things like defects, missed requirements, scope creep, over-engineered features, and frustrated users - due to a lack of elicitation and analysis.  
Rework is typically a result of moving forward to development without really knowing what the true needs and scope are.  
When doing great requirements work, we break down the request into the true need and functionality, understanding the data, people, process, rules, policies, and the various intricacies of what goes on behind the system.  

### The Relationship of Elicitation and Analysis  
Involves iterations and increments.  
Elicit to have something to analyse -> and analyse to know what more to elicit and determine what still needs to be discovered.  
Elicitation and analysis often happen at the same time, in the same meeting meaning some of the techniques used to elicit are also used to analyse.  
For example - asking questions in an interview leads to more questions and asking about a process leads to the completion of a process model.  

### Levels of Detail in Elicitation and Analysis  
Progressive elaboration = Layers:  
1st layer = problem or opportunity -> What problem will the project, product, enhancement, or defect solve? What opportunity will it help us take advantage of?  
Help the stakeholders understand why the solution is important and create a shared understanding of the team's purpose.  
2nd layer = user of the product/system/process and their goals -> who, what, why (role, goal, benefit)  
Understanding the goals the user has when using the product.  
3rd layer = peeling back each goal to uncover more details
Looking at details needed for each goal - data, rules, user interface, automation, interfaces with other systems etc.  
If levels are skipped then we are likely to end up solving the wrong problem.  

### Key Mindsets to be Successful  
Elicitation can sometimes feel like mindreading, therapy, facilitation, analysis all combined.  
- Keep focused on building the right thing for the customers, users and business - what they value may be different from what you or the team value.  
- Use collaboration skills to open stakeholder minds - stated requirements from stakeholders are almost never complete.  
- Get the team talking and drawing - visuals and conversations are much more effective than documents and text.  
- Use your unique perspective (the big picture AND the details) to help the business to make the right decisions about what they need and to help the dev teams to build it.
