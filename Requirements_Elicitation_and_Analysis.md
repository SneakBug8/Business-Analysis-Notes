# Requirements Elicitation and Analysis:  

## Elicitation and Analysis Overview  

### What is Elicitation and Analysis?  

`Elicitation is the discover and progressive elaboration of understanding the needs of our stakeholders and customers.`  

Critical to understand if the solution we're working on is right for the stakeholders, customers, and the organization.  
Everyone has ideas - stakeholders, customers, users, developers. Elicitation and analysis finds the actual needs of the customers.  

**Elicitation** allows BAs to find out if they are working on solving a defect, understanding requirements for an enhancement request, or developing a new product, service, or process.  
It involves a set of techniques that goes beyond what's stated, beyond what the data says, and beyond everyone's ideas.  
The process helps the team evolve their ideas into requirements that will take a solution or product into alignment with what the customer needs, and serves the organization strategy.  

**Analysis** takes the information elicited, and looks at where the gaps and impacts are by breaking it down and looking at different angles.  
The angles you can examine are of a sequence, data, logical rules, the people involved, handoffs, and the various relationships that exist - how they all work together to achieve the goal of the product and improve the customer experience.  
Analysis involves a combination of thinking, inspiring dialog, and analysis with others. It involves modeling, diagramming, and documenting to bring out the various angles to ensure impact, gaps, scenarios, and connections are well understood by the team.  

### The Role of Elicitation and Analysis in Requirements  
True elicitation and analysis is more about dialog, shared understanding, visuals, and exploring.  

**Elicitation** is the discovery and evolution of thought for what you are building - learning together as a team what is the right thing to build for the customer.  
Many times, stakeholders are simply voicing what their needs are in the only way they know how to voice them at the time - a customer's stated requirements can actually vary greatly from the true need.  
Elicitation gives them the opportunity to evolve their thoughts, think out loud, and sit with their thoughts - to co-create their idea and solutions with you and the team.  

**Analysis** is analysing the information elicited and bringing back meaningful models, questions, conversation, and diagrams back to the team in order to elicit more.  
Using various techniques to break down, sum up, and organize the information into views that help you and the team.  

#### What to Analyse?  
- Poeple who use the system and their interactions  
- Data, rules, and scenarios that drive user behaviour and needs  
- Others who amy be impacted  

Analysing from a user's point of view helps ensure that what gets built is actually satisfying the user's needs.  
Analysis allows us to firgure out what information we do have and what we don't so that we know what to ask.  

### Why is it Important?  
Most projects experience a large amount of rework and waste, things like defects, missed requirements, scope creep, over-engineered features, and frustrated users - due to a lack of elicitation and analysis.  
Rework is typically a result of moving forward to development without really knowing what the true needs and scope are.  
When doing great requirements work, we break down the request into the true need and functionality, understanding the data, people, process, rules, policies, and the various intricacies of what goes on behind the system.  

### The Relationship of Elicitation and Analysis  
Involves iterations and increments.  
Elicit to have something to analyse -> and analyse to know what more to elicit and determine what still needs to be discovered.  
Elicitation and analysis often happen at the same time, in the same meeting meaning some of the techniques used to elicit are also used to analyse.  
For example - asking questions in an interview leads to more questions and asking about a process leads to the completion of a process model.  

### Levels of Detail in Elicitation and Analysis  
Progressive elaboration = Layers:  
1st layer = problem or opportunity -> What problem will the project, product, enhancement, or defect solve? What opportunity will it help us take advantage of?  
Help the stakeholders understand why the solution is important and create a shared understanding of the team's purpose.  
2nd layer = user of the product/system/process and their goals -> who, what, why (role, goal, benefit)  
Understanding the goals the user has when using the product.  
3rd layer = peeling back each goal to uncover more details
Looking at details needed for each goal - data, rules, user interface, automation, interfaces with other systems etc.  
If levels are skipped then we are likely to end up solving the wrong problem.  

### Key Mindsets to be Successful  
Elicitation can sometimes feel like mindreading, therapy, facilitation, analysis all combined.  
- Keep focused on building the right thing for the customers, users and business - what they value may be different from what you or the team value.  
- Use collaboration skills to open stakeholder minds - stated requirements from stakeholders are almost never complete.  
- Get the team talking and drawing - visuals and conversations are much more effective than documents and text.  
- Use your unique perspective (the big picture AND the details) to help the business to make the right decisions about what they need and to help the dev teams to build it.  

## Elicitation Techniques  

### Elicitation Overview  
Projects are like icebergs and at the beginning we can only see the tip - we use elicitation techniques to help our stakeholders find the requirements, needs, risks, dependencies, assumptions, and opportunities that lie below the surface.  
Our stakeholders see the solution differently than engineers and developers do. We need to help them connect the dots by using high-impact collaboration techniques.  
Collaborative Elicitation:  
- planned and unplanned activities  
- vary techniques by level of formality  
- VARIETY (one technique is not enough)  
- do research to elicit (industry best practices for the process and technologies related to the subject domain)

### Interviews  
- Relationship building tool and deeper dive into the details of someone's domain or scope of work.  
- Value can be found in interviewing anyone involved in the project - sponsors, SMEs, business managers, customers and users.  
- Interviews should be strategic - helping to build or smooth relationships with key stakeholders or elicit details in areas of complexity.  
- Break each interview into three steps: 
**Prepare:**  
- Who are you interviewing?  
- What is their role and how can I make a personal connection with them?  
- What is my goal for the interview? (relationship building, understanding detailed information, thought provoking to evolve solution concepts?)  
- Engaging questions - to open up the dialogue  
- Probing questions - to elicit more detail  

**Conduct:**  
- Take the time to build rapport  
- Have 3-5 questions prepared for a 60 minute interview  
- Keep it converstaional and not rigid or structured  
- Create a framework of bullets (trying to take extensive notes can distract and wreck the flow)  

**Follow Up:**  
- Touch base after interview to make sure key points were captured correctly  
- Ask interviewee to clarify and validate a few important points (instead of giving them reams of notes to read)  
- Ask interviewee to review a visual model of your understanding of the details  

### Brainstorming  
- When done correctly it inspires creative thinking, new ideas, or a new approach to a problem.  
Things to brainstorm:  
- stakeholders who are impacted  
- features of a solution  
- solution options and alternatives  
- risks  
- ways to resolve issues  
- reactions and feelings that users might have when using a product  
- scenarios and exception paths  

Planning and good techniques are needed for effective brainstorming sessions:  
- Individual brainstorming - have a group silently think about their ideas  
- Group brainstorming  
- Flip charts, sticky notes - allows users to be active and anonymous when putting forward their ideas  

When done well brainstorming can boost group dynamics, generate powerful ideas, neutralize strong personalities, and elicit requirements quickly.  

### Observation (shadowing)  
- Not just watching people use the product but looking at how they go about the task, what problem they're trying to solve and the emotions that they have.  
- What thought processes are they using while using the product?  
- What tools are they using outside of the product or system?  
- What feelings does the user ahve while using the system?  
- When are they using additional knowledge? (from another system, their head)
- Is the system working as expected?  
- Be careful of changes in behaviour because the user knows they are being watched.  
- Be careful of the level of skill of the user you are observing - are they an average, super or struggling user?  
- Typically users do not use a product the way we would expect them to.  

Two types of observation:  
**Active:**  
- Working with the user - asking questions to understand and confirm the processes  
- Takes longer because of interruptions

**Passive:**  
- No interaction with user (sometimes they don't even know they are being observed)  
- What is frustrating for them? What is delighting them?  
- Takes less time  

### Experiments  
Sometimes people have blind spots due to complexity, ambiguity, or just plain uncertainty about the future.  
Experimenting is about learning the unknown, testing ideas, assumptions, and key theories that drive requirements for products and systems.  
Identify what you want to learn more about and design an experiment to bring the team the needed information.  
Experimenting helps teams get through the times when requirements are hard to get at or, on the other side of the equation, requirements keep changing.  

Plan an experiment:  
- What do we want to learn? (What information could we gather that would help the team make decisions?)  

Experiments are powerful and can get teams realtime information that shines a spotlight on the true needs and requirements of users.

### Workshops 
Strategically drawing out information from stakeholders and customers.  
High impact collaboration, deep dialogue, learning, exploring ideas and details.  
Inspire attendees to learn from each other.  

Plan a workshop:  
- Define your goal (What is the purpose of the workshop? What information do I need to elicit? How to make this valuable to the stakeholders that attend?)
- Determine who to invite (What will their role be? Who are the key stakeholders required to help me achieve my goal?)  
- Discuss roles and agenda with stakeholders before the workshop and help them understadn what's in it for them.  
- Design the workshop (engaging activities, games, small group work sessions, large group discussion)  
- Interactive, visual activities - brainstorming, sticky notes, group modeling and diagramming, collaborative games.  

BA Role:  
- Help draw out information needed to achieve your goal  
- Be a neutral facilitator  
- Support the process by prmoting diverent thinking first, and then helping the team converge to decisions.  
- Use the parking lot - a space to put information to revisit at a later time.  
- Keep the group focused on meeting the goal and not get distracted by subtopics.  
- Follow up and share valuable workshop artefacts with the team - keep it short - key items, key decisions, valuable models, lists, and diagrams.  

## Analysis Techniques  

### Analysis Overview  
Analysis involves discovering and connecting the big picture, the details and the value for users and their goals, data, rules and decisions, and gaps.  
Analysis helps us ensure complete and high quality requirements by helping stakeholders see and understand the same tree.  
Analysis identifies connections, gaps, impacts and questions that have not yet been discussed.  
Analysis involves a combination of thinking, dialogue, modeling, diagramming, and organising information in various views to help us think about and look at the product, process, or system from various perspectives.  

Analysis can be:  
- Solo or collaborative  
- Varied in formality - elaborate techniques with intricate steps or informal conversations.  
- VARIETY (one technique is not enough)  

### Process Models  
- Visual aid to explain a process or sequence of activities  
Used to:  
- Ignite dialogue on the team  
- See where the details fit into the big picture  
- Visualise the process  
- Organise requirements information  
- Analyse various detailed aspects of the system, product or process  

Keep it simple - stakeholders and the team must be able to read and understand the models intuitively (the dialogue should be about the process, not how to read it)  

Process Model Principles:  
- Know what you are modeling (current state? future state?)  
- Progressively elaborate and build in layers  
- Name the process and the activities in a verb-noun format (be specific and avoid vagues like handle, manage, process, coordinate)(select to checkout -> enter payment details -> confirm payment -> create account -> subscribe to newsletter)  

Use simple process models with details provided as supplements (decisions tables to include the logic within each step)  

### Context Diagrams  
Provide the solution's big picture by providing a view of the system or product in its environment, including the systems and people it interacts with - helps to identify scenarios, users, user goals, and external systems.  

Creating a context diagram:  
- Start with the name of your product in the centre  
- Add key people/roles -> customer, manager, order specialist, shipper, warehouse worker etc.  
- Add internal and external systems -> payment processors, internal data stores etc.  
- Explore the interactions between entities and goals using arrows and a phrase to describe
