## The Business Analysis Process Model  

### An approach to problem solving:  
Creative problem solving is vital in the business world as, increasingly, organisations need to develop innovative ideas in order to respond to changes in the business environment including actions from competitors.  

**Isaksen and Treffinger’s** problem solving model provides a useful framework for understanding problems and developing creative solutions, particularly as the model emphasises the need to investigate and analyse rather than leap to quick, possibly premature, solutions.

Stages 1-3 are concerned with understanding the problem and provide a structure for doing this. Stages 4-5 focus on developing solutions. The final stage is concerned wiht gaining business acceptance of the solution.  
1. **Mess finding:**  
This stage is concerned with finding out about the complexity of the problem situation. Many problems are poorly defined or ambiguous, and each problem situation is likely to be complex and contain various issues and concerns. Many problems are poorly defined or ambiguous - a mess - and each problem is likely complex and contains various issues and concerns. Starting at this point helps to emphasise the importance of gaining some understanding of the complete situation before diving into solutions and options.  

2. **Data finding:**  
Analysing the concerns and knowledge uncovered in the first stage. It is important to consider what data is fact and what is opinion. Quantative data is useful here.  

3. **Problem finding:**  
Using the first two stages to uncover the heart of the problem. Finding the right problem to solve is often a necessary part of business analysis, as analysts are often pointed at symptoms and they have to dig deeper in order to find out where the real problems lie.  

4. **Idea finding:**  
Two examples of techniques that can provide stimuli for creative ideas are ‘Assumption Reversal’ – where assumptions about a situation are listed and reversed – and ‘Random Words or Pictures’ – where unrelated words or pictures are used to generate different ideas about a situation.  

5. **Solution finding:**  
Once the problems have been identified and ideas discussed then they can be evaluated to see which could provide solutions to the problems. It is important to work through the earlier stages as they will help you to develop better, more appropriate solutions.  

6. **Acceptance finding:**  
This aspect is critical to the success of any change project. It is vital to ensure changes align with the business architecture and to consider how the feasibility of proposed solutions may be evaluated and how a robust business case may be made in order to obtain approval from the business.  

### The Business Analysis Process Model:  
The challenges faced in developing a process model are to offer something that is sufficiently flexible while providing a framework that will help people to carry out their work.
