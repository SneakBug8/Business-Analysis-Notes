Alignment and Definisiton stages involve:  
- Analysis of the organisation  
- Its business needs  
- The requirements which determine new ways to improve effectiveness and efficiency of the business

Subsequent stages involve:  
- Change, design and development  
- Business acceptance testing  
- Implementation of new IT systems  
- Realisation of bunsiess benefits  

The analysis portion of the BCL falls to the BA.  
Issues arise if the BA is not involved in this:  
- definition of business needs and requirements for meeting these needs are often unclear and not aligned  

It is critical to ensure that the focus is on understanding the problems that are to be addressed rather than on IT solutions to be developed  

A lack of clarity on the issues can result in failure to deliver business beefits and wastage of invested resources.
