## Investigation Techniques  

This is not a checklist. It is the creation of a toolbox. Not all methods will be used for each study but the more tools available, the more flexible and responsive the analyst can be.  

#### Prior Research:  
When an analyst first approaches their client organisation, (or division or department), they should first spend time gathering as much background information as they can.  

-> Study the website:  
This is the quickest way to get a view of what the organisation does, what its values are, how it brands itself and how it wants to be perceived.  
At this stage you will be looking particularly at its branding, its apparent values and priorities, how easy it is to navigate and interact with the site.  
Look for feedback from customers if applicable - particularly look for negative feedback. It is also worth checking other websites for feedback (Google, Trustpilot).  

One useful inference from the design of the website is how the company views its place strategically, in terms of the balance between the cost and the perceived quality of its products. The design of the website will often give an indication of the level of quality it aims at.  

We can also evaluate the ease of navigating around the site, placing an order or making an enquiry. These things will give an idea of the level of professionalism of the site and expected standards of technology presentation and achievement. This in turn can provide clues about the technological maturity of the company – is the technology aligned to the business intention, or are the developers showing off their skills at the expense of the company’s message?  

-> Study Company Reports:  
Companies with limited liability are required to file statutory documents reporting on their financial position.  The shareholders’ reports will also set out the future direction of the company as agreed by the Directors, and state the targets and aims for the next year. Again, the report should explicitly explain the target market and strategy intentions, which will give the analyst insights into the business perspectives.  

-> Study Procedure Manuals and Documentation:  
Many business analysis projects will have a scope that is more local than those suggested above, and more focused on specific sets of processes. The prior research for such projects will include studying current system documentation and any procedures manuals. These are to give an idea of the expected ‘as-is’ process, but another note of caution – over time such documentation will naturally become unrepresentative of the actual course of the process. It will tell you not so much the ‘as-is’ description as the ‘what-we-thought-it-ought-to-have-been’.  

-> Study the Organisation Chart:  
The organisation chart sets out the management structure of the organisation and can offer insights into the style and culture of the organisation. Understanding the job roles and reporting lines is a valuable preparation for the more detailed investigation to follow.  

**Studying the documentation is never a substitute for proper investigation and analysis; rather it enables preparation, a prior understanding of the domain in question that gives the analyst an entry point for various lines of investigation.**  

### Investigation Techniques  
After the prior research has been done, the analyst needs to consider how to conduct the more detailed investigation. What techniques are used will depend on the size of the domain in question, its location, the number of stakeholders to be consulted, and the nature of the information to be ascertained.  

#### Qualitative Investigation:  
- Interviews:  
A well-run interview can be vital in achieving a number of objectives. These include:  
making initial contact with key stakeholders and establishing a basis for the business analysis work;  
building and developing rapport with different business users and managers;  
acquiring information about the business situation, including any issues and problems;  
discovering different stakeholder perspectives and priorities.  

There are three areas that are considered during fact-finding or requirements interviews:  
current functions that need to be fulfilled in any new business system;  
problems with the current operations or performance that need to be addressed;  
additional features required from the new business system.  

Advantages of Interviewing:  
- builds a relationship with the clients -> it is critical that we understand the perspectives of the people involved with the business system.  
- yields important information -> usually includes details about the current operations, including difficulties in carrying out the work, and will help with the identification of requirements for the new business system.  
- provides an opportunity to understand different viewpoints and attitudes across the group  
- provides an opportunity to investigate new areas previously not mentioned  
- enables the BA to identify and collect examples of documents, forms and reports used by the client  
- allows an appreciation of political factors that may affect how the business performs its work  
- provides an opportunity to study the environment in which the staff carry out their work  

Disadvantages of Interviewing:  
- time consuming (especially if users are spread across sites)  
- information provided contains a lot of opinion and needs to be verified by quantitative data  
- differing opinions can create additional gaps and conflicts  

Preparing for interviewing:  
Who? Why? What? When? Where? is an excellent framework  

**Who?**  
Usually begins with more senior stakeholders as this helps understand the context of the problem before uncovering more details. Senior staff can provide an overview and is also able to identify the key people to see and make any necessary introductions.  

STOP model illustrates a simple hierarchy:  
**S**  
Strategic -> confirm the terms of reference, understand any managements inforamtion needs, agree the opproach and ensure the prject is aligned with business objectives and strategy.  
**T**  
Tactical -> issues of performance, targets and management control. CSFs (Critical Success Factors) and KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) that have been chosen. Processes and finctions carried out in the department and key people.  
**OP**  
Operational -> people who perform the actual tasks. Can describe accurately the existing business situation and can identify problems and current workarounds.  

**Why?**  
The objectives of the interview may range from the detailed elicitation of business needs to just establishing a good rapport and working relationship with a key stakeholder. The forms of questioning and of note-taking will differ significantly depending upon the objectives of the interview.  

**What?**  
Answering the ‘what?’ question helps identify the items to be discussed during the interview and provides the foundation for the agenda. Issuing an agenda two days or so before the interview helps to focus the mind of the interviewer and enables the interviewee to prepare by considering in advance the information required.  

**When?**  
Venue, timing and duration of interview. Limiting time to a max of 1 hour:  
Interviewees are busy  
Too long and people become unproductive  
Too long and too many notes  

**Where?**  
Interviewee's own territory where they feel comfortable  
Interviewer can observe the formal working environment  
Relevant source documents to hand on site  

| Open | Body | Close |
| ---- | ---- | ----- |
| Introductions and Setting the scene | Questions and Answers | Summarise and Next steps |  

**Intro**  
Personal introductions and setting the purpose of the interview  
Explaining helps put the interviewee at ease and help them provide relevant information  

**Body**  
A good approach is to begin by obtaining a context for the information this interviewee can provide. This context will usually cover the responsibilities of the interviewee, and their range of responsibilities.  
Essential to take notes (draw diagrams to understand procedures - flow chart)(mind maps are excellent for what has been said and area for further discussion)  

**Close**  
It is important to close the interview formally. The analyst should:

Summarise the points covered and the actions agreed.
Explain what happens next, both with regard to the particular interview and the project. We will usually send the interviewee a copy of the written-up notes so that they can check for any errors.
Ask the interviewee how any further contact should be made; managing the interviewee’s expectations of future behaviour can be extremely useful and will be invaluable if we need any additional information or clarifications at a later point. This also serves to keep the door open for a future interview session if required.

Following up the interview:  
Write up notes as soon as possible adn send copies to relevant parties. Once approved, file them as a formal part of the prject documentation.  

- Observation:  
There are several different approaches to observation, depending upon the level and focus of interest: formal observation, shadowing, protocol analysis and ethnographic studies.  
It is important to reassure the person being observed that their performance is not being judged. Protocols must be observed and trade unions must be informed.  

Advantages of Observation:  
- We obtain a much better understanding of the problems and difficulties faced by the business users.  
- Seeing a task performed will help us prepare appropriate questions for a more in-depth interview with the person responsible for that task.  
- It will help us to devise workable solutions that are more likely to be acceptable to the business.  

Disadvantages of Observation:  
- It is quite unnerving and people will often change their behaviour despite reassurances  

#### Types of Observation:  
Formal:  
Useful tool to understand the environment.  
Care must be taken to avoid the task being carried out 'by the rulebook' instead of how it has evolved over time.  
Ask questions about the task but avoid sounding critical in tone or words  
Do not interfere with the task  
Observe the task several times in order to understand the sequence, observe exceptions, timings etc.  
Sketch the physical layout of the task  

Protocol Analysis:  
Perform and describe - asking staff to carry out a task while describing the steps  
The higher the level of unconscious skill involved in a task the harder it is to explain  
Delivers a greater understanding of a task - useful for training people as well  

Shadowing:  
Follow a user for a period of time (one or two days)  
Powerful tool for understanding a particular role  
Explanations can be sought for what work is done, information used, workflow sequences etc.  
Uncovers taken-for-granted aspects of the work  
Useful during the requirements definition work as it provides a visual context for processes described during interviews or workshops.  

Workshops:  
Provide a collaborative forum where issues can be discussed, conflicts resolved and requirements elicited.  
Other activities include compliling process models, understanding data requirements, eliciting CSFs and KPIs and analysing the quality of a requirements set before they are formally documented.  
Very usefull when time is tight as they allow several viewpoints to be canvassed.

Advantages of Workshops:  
- Gain a broad view of the area under investigation: having a group of stakeholders in one room will allow the analyst to gain a more complete understanding of the issues and problems.  
- Increase speed and productivity: it is less time-consuming to have one extended meeting with a group of people than interviewing them one-by-one.  
- Obtain buy-in and acceptance for the project: when stakeholders are involved in such collaboration, not only will they be more open to any business changes or features that result but they are more likely to be champions of the change.  
- Gain a consensus view or group agreement: if all the stakeholders are involved in the decision-making process there is a greater chance that they will take ownership of the results. If two or more stakeholders have different viewpoints at the outset, there is a better chance of helping them move to an agreement in a well-facilitated workshop, as long as they feel that their concerns and views have been listened to respectfully.  

Disadvantages of Workshops:  
- Can be time-consuming and must be carefully managed so that one voice does not drown out others.  
- Care must be taken for level of authority with regards to decisions - is the person qualified to make that decision?  

Preparing for workshops:  
- Objective:  
Must be achieved within the time constraints. Either split into multiple sub workshops or kept simple  

- Who is invited:  
All stakeholders interested should either be invited or represented - it is the organisers responsibilty that interested parties are able to contribute.  
Breakout groups or other tasks can be used  
Consider personalities, concerns and viewpoints of all invited  

- Structure and techniques to be used:  
Achieve the defined objective  
Take into account the nature of the group, needs of the attendees and their preferred participation style (standard brainstorming might not work well for a group that have never met or who don't often work together)  

- Venue:  
Provide an environment for focused participation  
May be in site or at a neutral venue (better for contentious issues or to prevent attendees being called away by managers or colleagues)  

Facilitating workshops:  
Discuss the objective(s) and endeavour to secure the participants buy-in  
Invite a senior manager if difficulties are anticipated to define ground-rules and ensure the smoooth running  
Ensure the issues are discussed, views are aired and progress is made towards the objective - allow to discussion to range widely but ensure it doesn't go completely off-track.  
Ensure all are able to express their concerns  
Keep a record of key points - appoint someone to take the role of scribe (allowing the facilitator to focus entirely on the workshop)  
At the end of the workshop, the facilitator needs to summarise the key points and actions. Each action should be assigned to an owner and allocated a timescale for completion.

Ethnographic Studies:  
Often beyond the budget of most projects - involves spending extended periods of time in the target environment.  
People become used to the observer and over time return to their natural behaviours  


#### Quantitative Investigation:
