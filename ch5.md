## Investigation Techniques  

This is not a checklist. It is the creation of a toolbox. Not all methods will be used for each study but the more tools available, the more flexible and responsive the analyst can be.  

#### Prior Research:  
When an analyst first approaches their client organisation, (or division or department), they should first spend time gathering as much background information as they can.  

-> Study the website:  
This is the quickest way to get a view of what the organisation does, what its values are, how it brands itself and how it wants to be perceived.  
At this stage you will be looking particularly at its branding, its apparent values and priorities, how easy it is to navigate and interact with the site.  
Look for feedback from customers if applicable - particularly look for negative feedback. It is also worth checking other websites for feedback (Google, Trustpilot).  

One useful inference from the design of the website is how the company views its place strategically, in terms of the balance between the cost and the perceived quality of its products. The design of the website will often give an indication of the level of quality it aims at.  

We can also evaluate the ease of navigating around the site, placing an order or making an enquiry. These things will give an idea of the level of professionalism of the site and expected standards of technology presentation and achievement. This in turn can provide clues about the technological maturity of the company – is the technology aligned to the business intention, or are the developers showing off their skills at the expense of the company’s message?  

-> Study Company Reports:  
Companies with limited liability are required to file statutory documents reporting on their financial position.  The shareholders’ reports will also set out the future direction of the company as agreed by the Directors, and state the targets and aims for the next year. Again, the report should explicitly explain the target market and strategy intentions, which will give the analyst insights into the business perspectives.  

-> Study Procedure Manuals and Documentation:  
Many business analysis projects will have a scope that is more local than those suggested above, and more focused on specific sets of processes. The prior research for such projects will include studying current system documentation and any procedures manuals. These are to give an idea of the expected ‘as-is’ process, but another note of caution – over time such documentation will naturally become unrepresentative of the actual course of the process. It will tell you not so much the ‘as-is’ description as the ‘what-we-thought-it-ought-to-have-been’.  

-> Study the Organisation Chart:  
The organisation chart sets out the management structure of the organisation and can offer insights into the style and culture of the organisation. Understanding the job roles and reporting lines is a valuable preparation for the more detailed investigation to follow.  

**Studying the documentation is never a substitute for proper investigation and analysis; rather it enables preparation, a prior understanding of the domain in question that gives the analyst an entry point for various lines of investigation.**  

### Investigation Techniques  
After the prior research has been done, the analyst needs to consider how to conduct the more detailed investigation. What techniques are used will depend on the size of the domain in question, its location, the number of stakeholders to be consulted, and the nature of the information to be ascertained.  

#### Qualitative Investigation:  
- Interviews:  
A well-run interview can be vital in achieving a number of objectives. These include:  
making initial contact with key stakeholders and establishing a basis for the business analysis work;  
building and developing rapport with different business users and managers;  
acquiring information about the business situation, including any issues and problems;  
discovering different stakeholder perspectives and priorities.  

There are three areas that are considered during fact-finding or requirements interviews:  
current functions that need to be fulfilled in any new business system;  
problems with the current operations or performance that need to be addressed;  
additional features required from the new business system.  

Advantages of Interviewing:  
- builds a relationship with the clients -> it is critical that we understand the perspectives of the people involved with the business system.  
- yields important information -> usually includes details about the current operations, including difficulties in carrying out the work, and will help with the identification of requirements for the new business system.  
- provides an opportunity to understand different viewpoints and attitudes across the group  
- provides an opportunity to investigate new areas previously not mentioned  
- enables the BA to identify and collect examples of documents, forms and reports used by the client  
- allows an appreciation of political factors that may affect how the business performs its work  
- provides an opportunity to study the environment in which the staff carry out their work  

Disadvantages of Interviewing:  
- time consuming (especially if users are spread across sites)  
- information provided contains a lot of opinion and needs to be verified by quantitative data  
- differing opinions can create additional gaps and conflicts  

Preparing for interviewing:  
Who? Why? What? When? Where? is an excellent framework  

**Who?**  
Usually begins with more senior stakeholders as this helps understand the context of the problem before uncovering more details. Senior staff can provide an overview and is also able to identify the key people to see and make any necessary introductions.  

STOP model illustrates a simple hierarchy:  
**S**  
Strategic -> confirm the terms of reference, understand any managements inforamtion needs, agree the opproach and ensure the prject is aligned with business objectives and strategy.  
**T**  
Tactical -> issues of performance, targets and management control. CSFs (Critical Success Factors) and KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) that have been chosen. Processes and finctions carried out in the department and key people.  
**OP**  
Operational -> people who perform the actual tasks. Can describe accurately the existing business situation and can identify problems and current workarounds.  

**Why?**  
The objectives of the interview may range from the detailed elicitation of business needs to just establishing a good rapport and working relationship with a key stakeholder. The forms of questioning and of note-taking will differ significantly depending upon the objectives of the interview.  

**What?**  
Answering the ‘what?’ question helps identify the items to be discussed during the interview and provides the foundation for the agenda. Issuing an agenda two days or so before the interview helps to focus the mind of the interviewer and enables the interviewee to prepare by considering in advance the information required.  

**When?**  
Venue, timing and duration of interview. Limiting time to a max of 1 hour:  
Interviewees are busy  
Too long and people become unproductive  
Too long and too many notes  

**Where?**  
Interviewee's own territory where they feel comfortable  
Interviewer can observe the formal working environment  
Relevant source documents to hand on site
