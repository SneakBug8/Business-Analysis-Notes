# Investigation Techniques  

This is not a checklist. It is the creation of a toolbox. Not all methods will be used for each study but the more tools available, the more flexible and responsive the analyst can be.  

## Prior Research:  
When an analyst first approaches their client organisation, (or division or department), they should first spend time gathering as much background information as they can.  

-> **Study the website:**  
This is the quickest way to get a view of what the organisation does, what its values are, how it brands itself and how it wants to be perceived.  
At this stage you will be looking particularly at its branding, its apparent values and priorities, how easy it is to navigate and interact with the site.  
Look for feedback from customers if applicable - particularly look for negative feedback. It is also worth checking other websites for feedback (Google, Trustpilot).  

One useful inference from the design of the website is how the company views its place strategically, in terms of the balance between the cost and the perceived quality of its products. The design of the website will often give an indication of the level of quality it aims at.  

We can also evaluate the ease of navigating around the site, placing an order or making an enquiry. These things will give an idea of the level of professionalism of the site and expected standards of technology presentation and achievement. This in turn can provide clues about the technological maturity of the company – is the technology aligned to the business intention, or are the developers showing off their skills at the expense of the company’s message?  

-> **Study Company Reports:**  
Companies with limited liability are required to file statutory documents reporting on their financial position.  The shareholders’ reports will also set out the future direction of the company as agreed by the Directors, and state the targets and aims for the next year. Again, the report should explicitly explain the target market and strategy intentions, which will give the analyst insights into the business perspectives.  

-> **Study Procedure Manuals and Documentation:**  
Many business analysis projects will have a scope that is more local than those suggested above, and more focused on specific sets of processes. The prior research for such projects will include studying current system documentation and any procedures manuals. These are to give an idea of the expected ‘as-is’ process, but another note of caution – over time such documentation will naturally become unrepresentative of the actual course of the process. It will tell you not so much the ‘as-is’ description as the ‘what-we-thought-it-ought-to-have-been’.  

-> **Study the Organisation Chart:**  
The organisation chart sets out the management structure of the organisation and can offer insights into the style and culture of the organisation. Understanding the job roles and reporting lines is a valuable preparation for the more detailed investigation to follow.  

**Studying the documentation is never a substitute for proper investigation and analysis; rather it enables preparation, a prior understanding of the domain in question that gives the analyst an entry point for various lines of investigation.**  

## Investigation Techniques  
After the prior research has been done, the analyst needs to consider how to conduct the more detailed investigation. What techniques are used will depend on the size of the domain in question, its location, the number of stakeholders to be consulted, and the nature of the information to be ascertained.  

## Qualitative Investigation:  

## 5.1 Interviews:  

A well-run interview can be vital in achieving a number of objectives. These include:  
- making initial contact with key stakeholders and establishing a basis for the business analysis work;  
- building and developing rapport with different business users and managers;  
- acquiring information about the business situation, including any issues and problems;  
- discovering different stakeholder perspectives and priorities.  

There are three areas that are considered during fact-finding or requirements interviews:  
- current functions that need to be fulfilled in any new business system;  
- problems with the current operations or performance that need to be addressed;  
- additional features required from the new business system.  

### Advantages of Interviewing:  
- builds a relationship with the clients -> it is critical that we understand the perspectives of the people involved with the business system.  
- yields important information -> usually includes details about the current operations, including difficulties in carrying out the work, and will help with the identification of requirements for the new business system.  
- provides an opportunity to understand different viewpoints and attitudes across the group  
- provides an opportunity to investigate new areas previously not mentioned  
- enables the BA to identify and collect examples of documents, forms and reports used by the client  
- allows an appreciation of political factors that may affect how the business performs its work  
- provides an opportunity to study the environment in which the staff carry out their work  

### Disadvantages of Interviewing:  
- time consuming (especially if users are spread across sites)  
- information provided contains a lot of opinion and needs to be verified by quantitative data  
- differing opinions can create additional gaps and conflicts  

### Preparing for interviewing:  
Who? Why? What? When? Where? is an excellent framework  

#### Who?  
Usually begins with more senior stakeholders as this helps understand the context of the problem before uncovering more details. Senior staff can provide an overview and is also able to identify the key people to see and make any necessary introductions.  

STOP model illustrates a simple hierarchy:  
**S**  
Strategic -> confirm the terms of reference, understand any managements inforamtion needs, agree the opproach and ensure the prject is aligned with business objectives and strategy.  
**T**  
Tactical -> issues of performance, targets and management control. CSFs (Critical Success Factors) and KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) that have been chosen. Processes and finctions carried out in the department and key people.  
**OP**  
Operational -> people who perform the actual tasks. Can describe accurately the existing business situation and can identify problems and current workarounds.  

#### Why?  
The objectives of the interview may range from the detailed elicitation of business needs to just establishing a good rapport and working relationship with a key stakeholder. The forms of questioning and of note-taking will differ significantly depending upon the objectives of the interview.  

#### What?  
Answering the ‘what?’ question helps identify the items to be discussed during the interview and provides the foundation for the agenda. Issuing an agenda two days or so before the interview helps to focus the mind of the interviewer and enables the interviewee to prepare by considering in advance the information required.  

#### When?  
Venue, timing and duration of interview. Limiting time to a max of 1 hour:  
Interviewees are busy  
Too long and people become unproductive  
Too long and too many notes  

#### Where?  
Interviewee's own territory where they feel comfortable  
Interviewer can observe the formal working environment  
Relevant source documents to hand on site  

| Open | Body | Close |
| ---- | ---- | ----- |
| Introductions and Setting the scene | Questions and Answers | Summarise and Next steps |  

**Intro**  
Personal introductions and setting the purpose of the interview  
Explaining helps put the interviewee at ease and help them provide relevant information  

**Body**  
A good approach is to begin by obtaining a context for the information this interviewee can provide. This context will usually cover the responsibilities of the interviewee, and their range of responsibilities.  
Essential to take notes (draw diagrams to understand procedures - flow chart)(mind maps are excellent for what has been said and area for further discussion)  

**Close**  
It is important to close the interview formally. The analyst should:

Summarise the points covered and the actions agreed.
Explain what happens next, both with regard to the particular interview and the project. We will usually send the interviewee a copy of the written-up notes so that they can check for any errors.
Ask the interviewee how any further contact should be made; managing the interviewee’s expectations of future behaviour can be extremely useful and will be invaluable if we need any additional information or clarifications at a later point. This also serves to keep the door open for a future interview session if required.

Following up the interview:  
Write up notes as soon as possible adn send copies to relevant parties. Once approved, file them as a formal part of the prject documentation.  

## 5.2 Observation:  
There are several different approaches to observation, depending upon the level and focus of interest: formal observation, shadowing, protocol analysis and ethnographic studies.  
It is important to reassure the person being observed that their performance is not being judged. Protocols must be observed and trade unions must be informed.  

### Advantages of Observation:  
- We obtain a much better understanding of the problems and difficulties faced by the business users.  
- Seeing a task performed will help us prepare appropriate questions for a more in-depth interview with the person responsible for that task.  
- It will help us to devise workable solutions that are more likely to be acceptable to the business.  

### Disadvantages of Observation:  
- It is quite unnerving and people will often change their behaviour despite reassurances  

### Types of Observation:  
**Formal:**  
Useful tool to understand the environment.  
Care must be taken to avoid the task being carried out 'by the rulebook' instead of how it has evolved over time.  
Ask questions about the task but avoid sounding critical in tone or words  
Do not interfere with the task  
Observe the task several times in order to understand the sequence, observe exceptions, timings etc.  
Sketch the physical layout of the task  

**Protocol Analysis:**  
Perform and describe - asking staff to carry out a task while describing the steps  
The higher the level of unconscious skill involved in a task the harder it is to explain  
Delivers a greater understanding of a task - useful for training people as well  

**Shadowing:**  
Follow a user for a period of time (one or two days)  
Powerful tool for understanding a particular role  
Explanations can be sought for what work is done, information used, workflow sequences etc.  
Uncovers taken-for-granted aspects of the work  
Useful during the requirements definition work as it provides a visual context for processes described during interviews or workshops.  

**Ethnographic Studies:**  
Often beyond the budget of most projects - involves spending extended periods of time in the target environment.  
People become used to the observer and over time return to their natural behaviours  

## 5.3 Workshops:  
Provide a collaborative forum where issues can be discussed, conflicts resolved and requirements elicited.  
Other activities include compliling process models, understanding data requirements, eliciting CSFs and KPIs and analysing the quality of a requirements set before they are formally documented.  
Very useful when time is tight as they allow several viewpoints to be canvassed.

### Advantages of Workshops:  
- Gain a broad view of the area under investigation: having a group of stakeholders in one room will allow the analyst to gain a more complete understanding of the issues and problems.  
- Increase speed and productivity: it is less time-consuming to have one extended meeting with a group of people than interviewing them one-by-one.  
- Obtain buy-in and acceptance for the project: when stakeholders are involved in such collaboration, not only will they be more open to any business changes or features that result but they are more likely to be champions of the change.  
- Gain a consensus view or group agreement: if all the stakeholders are involved in the decision-making process there is a greater chance that they will take ownership of the results. If two or more stakeholders have different viewpoints at the outset, there is a better chance of helping them move to an agreement in a well-facilitated workshop, as long as they feel that their concerns and views have been listened to respectfully.  

### Disadvantages of Workshops:  
- Can be time-consuming and must be carefully managed so that one voice does not drown out others.  
- Care must be taken for level of authority with regards to decisions - is the person qualified to make that decision?  

### Preparing for Workshops:  
- **Objective:**  
Must be achieved within the time constraints. Either split into multiple sub workshops or kept simple  

- **Who is invited:**  
All stakeholders interested should either be invited or represented - it is the organisers responsibilty that interested parties are able to contribute.  
Breakout groups or other tasks can be used  
Consider personalities, concerns and viewpoints of all invited  

- **Structure and techniques to be used:**  
Achieve the defined objective  
Take into account the nature of the group, needs of the attendees and their preferred participation style (standard brainstorming might not work well for a group that have never met or who don't often work together)  

- **Venue:**  
Provide an environment for focused participation  
May be in site or at a neutral venue (better for contentious issues or to prevent attendees being called away by managers or colleagues)  

### Facilitating workshops:  
Discuss the objective(s) and endeavour to secure the participants buy-in  
Invite a senior manager if difficulties are anticipated to define ground-rules and ensure the smoooth running  
Ensure the issues are discussed, views are aired and progress is made towards the objective - allow to discussion to range widely but ensure it doesn't go completely off-track.  
Ensure all are able to express their concerns  
Keep a record of key points - appoint someone to take the role of scribe (allowing the facilitator to focus entirely on the workshop)  
At the end of the workshop, the facilitator needs to summarise the key points and actions. Each action should be assigned to an owner and allocated a timescale for completion.  

### Techniques to employ:  
**Discovery** techniques are those that help the facilitator to elicit information and views from the participants. It is vital that the facilitator considers which technique would be most suitable for a particular situation and group of participants.  
Many **visualisation** techniques are suitable for use in a workshop. Visual approaches are quick to understand and to explain, and they help workshop participants to access the information being captured.  

| **Discovery** |  | **Visualisation** |
| ---- | ---- | ----- |
| Round Robin | W | Process Models |  
| Branstorming | O | Rich Pictures |  
| Brainwriting | R | Mind Maps |  
| Post-It Exercise | K | Context Diagrams |  
| Stepwise Refinement | S | Use Case Diagrams |  
| Breakout Groups | H | Task Scenarios |  
|  | O | User Stories |  
|  | P |  |  

### Discovery:  
- **Brainstorming** (sometimes known as **idea storming**), where the participants are asked to call out ideas about a given item, all of which are written on a flipchart or whiteboard. It is important that all of the suggestions can be seen by everyone taking part as this allows the participants to build on each other’s ideas. Any evaluation of the ideas is suspended until everyone has finished making suggestions.  

- **Round robin** discussions where the workshop participants are asked for their ideas in turn. This can be very useful to encourage participation from those who do not like brainstorming because they are uncomfortable when required to shout out ideas. Round robin discussions provide everyone with an opportunity to speak without fear of interruption or being ignored.  

- **Brainwriting** which has similarities with brainstorming but requires participants to write down ideas. Each person writes an idea on a sheet of paper and then puts it in the middle of the table. Everyone then takes another sheet with an idea already written on it, writes down another idea and then returns the paper to the centre. This continues until there are no more ideas being generated. This approach is useful because it overcomes the problem of ‘shouting out’ while still enabling everyone to build on the ideas of the other workshop attendees.  

- **Sticky (post-it) note exercises** also involve writing down ideas but in this case, the participants work individually or in pairs. Each individual or pair writes down their suggestions – one per sticky note – and, once everyone has stopped writing, displays them to the group, usually by sticking them on a wall or board. Once all of the suggestions have been displayed, those that are similar are grouped together and broader themes are developed.  

- **Stepwise refinement** is where we take a statement or idea and keep asking ‘why?, why?’ to every answer until we think we’ve got to the heart of a problem, idea or situation.  

- **Smaller ‘break-out’ or ‘syndicate’ groups**, where specific aspects are considered and then reported back to the larger group. This is a powerful way to manage a larger workshop, particularly where there is a range of skills and knowledge. It can also be useful for each break-out group to have its own sub-facilitator.

Recognised organisational analysis techniques can also be used such as CSF analysis  

#### Following up the workshop:  
After the workshop any key points and actions are written up and sent to the relevant participants and stakeholders. This should be done as quickly as possible as this will help to keep up the momentum and highlight the need for quick action.  

### Hothouse Workshop:  
Applies Lean and Agile principles to a business problem.  
In Agile environments a project, or phase of a project, may be initiated by a hothouse workshop, bringing the business and development teams together to solve business problems and using prototypes to define the functionality and scope of the solution.  
This idea derives from the work of James Martin at IBM in the 1980s, when a Joint Requirements Planning (JRP) workshop brought senior executives and analysts together to define functionality, scope and timeframes for new developments. Hothouses combine this JRP approach with Lean techniques. As its name suggests, it is a very intense experience, often with participants working into the night, to produce prototype models of how the new solution might look. Hothouses typically take place over 2–3 days and are primarily for innovation projects rather than simple administration systems or enhancements to existing systems. The workshop group is typically split into smaller teams who each develop a prototype solution during a series of iterations. At the end of each iteration, the output is reviewed and feedback given which is used during the next iteration and so on. The hothouse may be run as a competition between the groups. Ultimately, the outcome should be a prototype solution to a business problem accompanied by additional analyses of the corresponding metrics, processes, costs and benefits required to enable the delivery of the full solution.  

### Focus Groups:  
Business and Market Research  
Focus-group participants should represent a sample of the target constituency, whether they be external customers or internal staff gathered from multiple sites and branches. They are given an opportunity to express their opinions and views, and to discuss them. In a focus group, unlike a workshop, there is no intention to form a consensus during the discussion, or for the group to acquire a sense of ownership of any decisions made or solutions identified.  
Good way of obtaining views and ideas but do not offer much in the way of design or obtaining quatitative data.  

## 5.4 Scenarios:  
Telling the story of a task or transaction.  
Useful for analysing or redesigning business processes as the steps can be visualised and thought through.  
A scenario description will include the business event that triggers the transaction, the set of actions that have to be completed in order to achieve a successful outcome and other aspects such as the actor responsible for carrying out the task, the preconditions and the postconditions.  
The preconditions are the characteristics of the business or state of the IT system that must be true for the scenario to begin.  
Postconditions are the characteristics that must be true following the conclusion of the scenario.

### Advantages of Scenarios:  
- They provide a framework for discovering the expections that require alternative paths when carrying out a task. Each step provides an opportunity to analysie what else might happen.  
- They require the user to include each step and the transitions between the steps, and as a result remove the opportunity for omissions.  
- The step-by-step development approach helps ensure that there are no taken-for-granted elements and the problem of tacit knowledge is addressed.  
- They are developed using a ‘top-down’ approach, starting with an overview scenario and then refining this with further detail. This helps the business user visualise all possible situations and removes uncertainty.  
- A workshop group refining a scenario will identify those paths that do not suit the corporate culture, or that are not congruent with any community of practice involved.  
- They provide a basis for developing prototypes.  
- They provide a tool for preparing test scripts.  

### Disadvantages of Scenarios:  
- Time-consuming to develop  
- Can become very complex - particularly where there are several alternative paths (consider treating each alternative path as a separate scenario)  

### Developing a Scenario:  
1. Identify the task or interaction to be modelled as a scenario and the trigger, or event, that causes that interaction to take place.  
2. Identify the steps that will be carried out during the usual progress of the interaction, and the flow of these steps.    
3. Define the control conditions; the conditions that must be met in order to move from one step to the next, following the typical sequence of steps.  
4. Identify the alternative paths that would be required to handle the situations where the control conditions are not met.  

This is the main scenario - happy day scenario - that assumes no complications and that everything is running as expected.  
Scenarios are powerful when eliciting information, because they break down each of the default steps to ask the questions ‘What needs to be true to continue with this path?’ and ‘At this point, what might happen instead?’ Once the alternatives have been uncovered the analyst can then ask the question ‘What should we do if this happens or if this is true?’  

It can be helpful for the analyst to present a prepared ‘happy day’ scenario which is then used as the basis for a discussion. An approach that helps encourage the business stakeholders to contribute wholeheartedly to this process involves placing them in break-out groups with the instruction to produce a concrete scenario that will break the ‘happy day’ path. Experience shows that this instruction sharpens their creativity and produces many valid extensions. All extensions, and resultant requirements, that are uncovered are then added to the analysis documentation.  

### Documenting Scenarios:  
A popular way of documenting scenario descriptions is to develop use case descriptions to support use case diagrams. This technique is part of the Unified Modeling Language (UML) and is a textual method. However, there are a number of graphical methods for documenting a scenario, such as storyboards, activity diagrams, task models and decision tree diagrams.  

### User Analysis:  
A starting point for understanding these users is to identify them and give them generic titles, like ‘customer’, ‘supplier’ or ‘regulator’. (There is a clear relationship here with stakeholder analysis)

However, sometimes these generic titles do not tell us enough about the business users for us to envisage how and why they might want to use an information system. ‘Customer’, for example, is a very broad term that may not capture the different sets of characteristics displayed by the actual customers of an organisation. A good way of understanding customers is to create ‘personas’ for them.  

Personas can also be useful when analysing the users of the business system who have particular accessibility requirements. For example, we may identify a persona that represents customers who have a specific disability that we need to understand in order to enable access to the available business services.

## 5.5 Prototyping:  
Prototyping is an important technique for eliciting, analysing, demonstrating and validating requirements.  
Users often don't know what they want, making it difficult for analysts to define requirements.  It is difficult to envisage requirements wihtout knowing what is possible - it is easier to review a suggested solutions and identify potential problems.  

Using a prototype often releases the blocks to thinking, and can result in greater understanding and clarity. Prototypes also offer a way of demonstrating how the new processes or system might work and provide a concrete basis for evaluation and discussion. Agile software development approaches, such as DSDM and Scrum, use evolutionary prototyping as an integral part of their development lifecycle.

Prototyping involves building simulations of a process or system in order to review them with the users to increase understanding about the requirements.  

A quick but effective form of prototyping is to use flipchart sheets, pens and packs of sticky notes and work with the users to develop paper prototypes. This will enable the users to develop screens, identify navigation paths, define the data they must input or refer to, and prepare lists of specified values that they know will apply. This approach can also be used to develop prototypes of a business process.  

Scenarios can be used as the basis for developing prototypes. As well as confirming requirements, prototyping can help the users to identify others that they had not considered previously.  

### Advantages of Prototyping:  
- to clarify any uncertainty on the part of the analysts and confirm to the user that we have understood what they asked for;  
- to help the user identify new requirements as they gain an understanding of what the system will be able to do to support their jobs;  
- to demonstrate the look and feel of the proposed system and elicit usability requirements;  
- to validate the system requirements and identify any errors;  
- to provide a means of assessing the navigation paths and system performance.  

### Disadvantages of Prototyping:  
Prototyping has a number of hazards, most of which can be avoided by setting clear objectives for the prototyping exercise and managing the stakeholders’ expectations.  
- The prototyping cycle can spin out of control with endless iterations taking place.  
- If the purpose of the exercise has not been explained clearly, the users may think that when they are happy with the mock-up, the system is now complete and ready for use.  
- User expectations can be raised unnecessarily by failing to mimic the final appearance of the system, or its performance; a system that is on a stand-alone machine with six dummy data records to search will be more responsive than a machine that is sharing resources with a thousand other machines on a national network, and has several million records to access. If there is likely to be a delay in the real response time, it is important that you build that into the prototype.  

Prototyping in Agile:  
In an Agile software development environment, prototyping sessions are used to elicit and analyse requirements, and to construct and test working functionality. The development work is conducted iteratively, with each iteration using the concept of a timebox or sprint, typically a predefined number of weeks, within which certain functionality is delivered. During the timebox, the selected requirements for that delivery will be validated, coded, tested and released. Contingency is provided by the prioritisation of the requirements, whereby some are designated at a lower level of priority and may be postponed to a later timebox if necessary. In this approach, the tension between time and quality is resolved in favour of time but, because Agile encourages iterative development, the quality – i.e. the scope of functionality – is merely postponed, not sacrificed. The prototyping approach allows the business to receive the most critical pieces of functionality when it needs it, and the less urgent functionality will be delivered in future iterations.  

## 5.6 Quantitative Investigation:  
Quantitative approaches are used to obtain data that is needed to quantify the information that has been provided during interviews, workshops or other qualitative techniques. Examples of the quantitative data we need could be the following: we might want to know the number of workers who use a particular system, the number of complaints received during a set period or the number of orders processed each day.  

### Surveys and Questionnaires:  
Useful for limited amounts of informations from a lot of people (when interviewing them infdividually or running multiple workshops is not feasible)  

Surveys must be carefully designed and contain a heading, classification and data section:  

**Heading:**  
Explain purpose and instructions to complete and return - this improves information provided and increases returns.  

**Classification:**  
Capture details of respondant - age, gender, length of service, role etc  
Confidence in anonymity must be provided so that data provided is reliable  

**Data:**  
Main body of questions  
Ideally should allow for yes/no answers (agree/disagree/neutral or excellent/satisfactory/inadequate etc)  
All responses should use the MECE (Musutally Exclusive, Completely Exhaustive) approach to ensure they cover every situation  
The aim is to extract meaningful data, observe patterns and draw relevant conclusions.  
Questions must not be ambiguous ('Have you used the website recently?' -> No (Could mean: not interested/does not know about website/not IT-literate/used it 3 months ago))

A key disadvantage is that people are not often motivated to complete surveys so it is important to clarify why their input is needed. Rewards can be an excellent motivator (prize draw) or asking the manager to instruct completion.  

### Special Purpose Records:  
Special purpose records are data-gathering forms used by the analyst; the format is usually decided by the analyst and they are not company records. They can be completed either by the analyst during an observation session or given to the business users to complete over a period of time.  

Can be completed by an analyst shadowing a staff memeber or given to the staff member to complete as they go about their tasks.  
There are difficulties with getting people to keep this form of record, chief of which is that it is easy to forget to record each occurrence. As with surveys, it is difficult to get people to buy-in to this task.  

Notwithstanding this, it can still be useful sometimes to get people to keep such records as they help avoid the problems associated with observation and it can be an effective use of the analyst’s time.  

### Activity Sampling:  
This can be used when it is necessary to know how people divide their work time among a range of activities. For example, how much time is spent on the telephone? How much time spent on reconciling payments? How much time on sorting out complaints?  

Activity sampling is more accurate than SPRs as it deals with the number of times an activity is carried out per day.  
An activity sampling exercise is carried out in five steps:  

1. Identify the activities to be recorded. This list should include a ‘not working’ activity as this covers breaks or times away from the desk. It might also include a ‘not-related’ task, such as first aid or health and safety officer duties.  
2. Decide on the frequency and timings, i.e. when and how often you will record the activities being undertaken.  
3. Visit the study group at the times decided upon and record what each group member is doing.  
4. Record the results.  
5. After a set period, analyse the results.  

By analysing that figure against other data, such as the total amount of time available, we are able to calculate the total length of time spent on that activity and the average time one occurrence of the activity will take. This information can be useful when developing business cases and evaluating proposed solutions. Also, it will raise other questions such as whether the average time is reasonable for this task or whether it indicates a problem somewhere else in the process.  

### Document Analysis:  
Document analysis involves reviewing samples of source documents to uncover information about an organisation, process or system.

For each document, we might analyse:  

How is the document completed?  
Who completes the document?  
Are there any validations or controls on the document?  
Who uses the completed document?  
When is the document used?  
How many are used or produced?  
How long is the document retained by the organisation, and in what form?  
What are the details of the information shown on the document?  
Where is the data or information obtained?  
Are other names used in the organisation for any of the items of data?  
Are all the data items on the document still needed, or are any redundant?  
Is there other data that is not entered on the document, but would be useful for this process?  

Document analysis is useful to supplement other techniques such as interviewing, workshops and observation. For example, analysing the origin and usage of a document can prove very enlightening when investigating a process. Samples of completed documents or system printouts also help to clarify the key items of data used to carry out the work and can prove an excellent basis for modelling data.  

Some of the techniques described above are suitable for general investigation of the problem situation and others more for eliciting requirements for the new system. Of those suitable for requirements, some are more suitable for a waterfall approach and others geared more towards Agile developments. Some techniques are suitable in all situations.  

The table below gives a guide to the suitability of these techniques for the different situations.

## 5.7 Documenting the Current Situation:  

While the investigation of the current situation is going on, the analyst will need to record the findings, in order to understand the range of issues and the business needs.  

### Rich Pictures:  
A Rich Picture is a way to explore, acknowledge and define a situation and express it through diagrams to create a preliminary mental model. A rich picture helps to open discussion and come to a broad, shared understanding of a situation.  
<img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/business-analysis-/9781780172774/images/figure5.5.jpg"><img>  

### Mind Maps:  
Mind maps are a useful tool for summarising a lot of information in a simple visual form that is structured to highlight connections between different ideas and topics. They provide a means of organising information while, in a similar vein to rich pictures, representing all of the issues that have been uncovered about the situation. A mind map helps structure the information gathered into a recognisable and manageable set of connections. Mind maps are extremely useful in helping analysts to order their thinking, and they work well both on their own and when used in conjunction with rich pictures.

The business system or problem under consideration is drawn at the centre of the diagram with the main elements shown as first level of branches radiating from the central point. Each of these branches is labelled to indicate the nature of the particular area or issue; the labels should use as few words as possible, ideally one word. The branches might represent such matters as particular processes, the equipment and systems used, relationships between the staff that do the job and so on. These branches can then support second-level branches that are concerned with more detailed areas for each aspect of the situation.

### Business Process Models:  
In order to understand fully how a process is carried out, it is helpful to draw a ‘swimlane’ diagram, which shows the tasks in a process, the actors responsible for carrying them out and the process flow. These models are easy to draw and business stakeholders find them accessible, so they provide a good communication tool between the analyst and the business staff. Business process models are also invaluable as a diagnostic aid since they help identify problems such as delays, bottlenecks and duplicate tasks.  
Swimlane example:

It is interesting to note that a swimlane diagram would not show the physical movement required for an actor to perform a task, so it would not highlight the potential for improvement.  

### Spaghetti Maps:  
A spaghetti map is a tool to show the movement and interactions of the stakeholders in a particular environment, when performing particular tasks and processes. It is called a spaghetti map simply because as the movements are drawn, the diagram created resembles a plate of spaghetti, with lines crossing back and forth without any apparent formality or design. Spaghetti maps can be drawn up during an observation session, mapping the movements of users across the room to meet different actors or to use equipment such as printers or photocopiers.

This spaghetti diagram shows a clerk in the service department of a garage checking in a car for repair and allocating a courtesy car to the customer. Despite having a computer on her desk she still needed to make use of a printer, a photocopier, a filing cabinet and a wall chart in order to perform the task. Their position on the map is similar to their position in the real office. It is easy to see how much of the clerk’s time is taken over the course of a day in accessing these different stations. This diagram represents one person executing one instance of a common task, and makes clear the scope for efficiency gains.  

### Fishbone Diagrams:  
One of the major objectives in investigating and modelling a business system is to identify where there are problems and discover their underlying causes. Some of these may be obvious, or the stakeholders may be aware of the root causes of their problems. However, sometimes it is only the symptoms that are highlighted by the stakeholders because the causes have proved difficult to isolate. The fishbone diagram is a problem-analysis technique, designed to help understand the underlying causes of an inefficient process or a business problem. It is similar to a mind map in some ways, but its purpose is strictly diagnostic.  
The technique was invented by Dr Kaoru Ishikawa (Ishikawa 1985), and the diagrams are sometimes known as Ishikawa diagrams. They are often used in root cause analysis. The name of the problem is documented in a box at the right-hand side of the diagrams. Stretching out from the box towards the left of the page is the backbone of the fish. Radiating up and down from this backbone are spines; the spines suggest possible areas for causes of the problem.  
A number of approaches may be used when labelling the spines:  
- The four Ms: manpower, machines, measures and methods.  
- An alternative four Ms: manpower, machines, materials and methods.  
- The six Ps: people, place, processes, physical evidence, product/service and performance measures.  
- The four Ss: surroundings, suppliers, systems and skills.  

These categories help because they list areas that have been found to be the sources of inefficiencies in many business systems. In practice we often consider a range of categories and might combine the most relevant elements from the approaches above, or even define some categories that are particularly relevant to a given project. Data for this analysis can be found from interviews, workshops, activity sampling, observation and special purpose records. The categories to be used on the fishbone diagrams can also provide a structure to a workshop discussion.
