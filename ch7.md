# Modelling Business Processes  

The business processes are the means by which an organisation carries out the internal operations and delivers its products and services to its customers.  

There are many reasons for creating business process models:  

- To **understand how the existing process** works. This can be particularly useful if the process has ‘grown’ organically (without any real planning) and no one is quite sure what happens currently in response to an event.  
- To **explain** to those working on the process what they do and how their task relates to the others working on the process. Here, the process model can be a **training aid** for new staff and a **reminder** for more experienced personnel.  
- To help ensure **consistency** of approach, so that everyone follows the same process and customers’ experiences are not wholly dependent on who is dealing with them, in other words the ‘luck of the draw’.  
- To **identify the problems and weaknesses of an existing business process** with a view to developing and implementing an improved one. A model of an existing business process is often called an ‘as is’ model and the improved one is known as a ‘to be’ model.  

## 7.1 Organisational Context:  

<img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/business-analysis-/9781780172774/images/figure7.1.jpg"><img>  

The functional view of an organisation is very useful for the internal management and staff to see how the organisation is structured and where they fit within it. However, there are some limitations with this view. It is predominantly internally oriented, concentrating on the structure of the organisation and the internal reporting lines, aspects that are usually of little interest to the organisation’s customers. Moreover, it defines the formal structure, ignoring the unofficial communication and cooperation between staff that can be just as important for success. The functional view is also ‘static’ as it does not show what the business does over time in order to react to an event such as a customer requesting a service.  

The static nature of the functional view contrasts sharply with the process view. The people carrying out the tasks within a process could well belong to several different functions and may need to pass information or products across functional boundaries. For example:  

- a customer may first tell a salesperson the details of an order;  
- the order is then passed onto warehouse staff to physically make up the order;  
- next, it is collected by logistics staff;  
- the goods are then delivered to the customer.  

The process view emphasises the need for cooperation between all the participants if the desired level of customer service is to be achieved. Thinking of the organisation as separate, autonomous departments may erect barriers and create operational difficulties that a more joined-up approach can overcome.  

## 7.2 An Alternative View of an Organisation:  

Paul Harmon (2007) developed the organisation model that provides an alternative view of an organisation, providing a representation of both the internal processes and the external world with which the organisation operates. The model is often developed in two stages: firstly, the external factors that influence the organisation are considered and then the internal business process is analysed.  

<img src="https://plsmindyourownbusiness.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/43604-harmonorganisationdiagram.jpg"><img>  

The four areas shown outside the organisation highlight those aspects of the external environment that need to be considered; they define the context in which the organisation operates. These four areas are:

- The suppliers of the resources required by the business processes. This covers not only the supply of physical materials but also external suppliers of finance, people and ideas.  
- The beneficiaries from the organisation. While we always include the customers who purchase the products and services within this group, it is also important to take a broader view and include other types of customer. For example, the owners and senior executives of the organisation, or partner organisations that provide a sales channel to the customers. The owners will vary depending upon the type of organisation. For example, in a commercial business there may be shareholders whereas in a not-for-profit organisation there will be a board of trustees. For each group of beneficiaries, we need to know the outcomes that they would like the organisation to deliver. These outcomes are often in conflict with each other; where customers would like prices to be as low as possible, shareholders would like to have high dividends which they may see resulting from higher prices.  
- The competitors operating within the same industry or business domain. Traditionally, this is interpreted to mean other organisations with whom we are competing in specific markets. In the organisational model, we extend the concept further by including those organisations that we are competing with for the supply of finance, services, skilled staff and ideas, as well as those who compete with us for customers.  
- The generic factors that may affect the organisation such as changing regulation, economics or green issues. These are the type of factors covered by a PESTLE (political, economic, socio-cultural, technological, legal and environmental) analysis.  

Analysing the external context on the organisation model encourages the business analyst to think carefully about the context for the organisation. For example:  

- What resources does it require to operate? Are these plentiful or are they in short supply? Against whom are we competing for scarce resources?  
- Who are the major competitors for the purchasing customers? What do their processes offer and can we improve on this?  
- What are the factors in the external environment that condition or constrain how we can operate?  
- Who are owners of the organisation that we need to satisfy? This is not always an easy question to answer, for example in the case of a state school: Is it the governors? The -local education authority? Central government? We may need to consider all of them.  
- Who exactly are our customers? What do they require from us? How demanding are they? What are their value expectations?  

The organisation’s business processes need to operate within this external environment. If we are carrying out a business process improvement project, it is important to understand the business context as this will help us determine the changes that will deliver business success.  

## 7.3 The Organisational View of Business Processes:  

Now that we have understood the circumstances in which the business operates, we can turn our attention to what the business does when reacting to the external environment. Bearing in mind that the organisation model is a high-level view of the processes that operate across the entire business, we need to show the end-to-end set of processes that convert the inputs from the suppliers to the outputs for the customers. It is possible to identify the high-level processes by discussing with the staff and managers of the organisation.  

INPUT --> PROCESS --> OUTPUT
Example for ordering goods:  
*Customer places order* --> **Record Order** --> **Take Payment** --> **Arrange Delivery** --> *Customer receives goods*

It is useful to distinguish between process maps and business process models. Process maps show sets of related processes, and their interactions, in a single diagram. Each process set is shown as a box and the arrows between them show their interdependencies. Business process models show a more detailed view of each of the processes within a higher level set.  

The overview process map is extremely useful when the analyst starts to model a particular process. It helps to identify the boundaries of each process by showing where the process begins and where it ends.  

An alternative approach to building a process map is to look at the products and services and consider what processes are required to deliver them. Michael Porter’s value chain is a useful technique here because it helps us to structure our thinking and possibly identify areas of process that we may have missed.  

<img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.business-to-you.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Value-Chain-1.png"><img>  

The value chain provides a means of analysing the activities performed by an organisation. It identifies key areas of primary and support activity that will be required to deliver value to the organisation’s customers and potentially differentiate the organisation from its competitors. We can use the concept of a value chain to develop high-level process maps for the organisation.  

When using the value chain, it is usually easiest to start with the operations – the core activity of this value chain – and then consider the other areas.  
Imagine a manufacturing organisation and the operations primary activity is ‘Make products’. However, we can only do this if we ‘Obtain raw materials’ so this is the inbound logistics activity. The outbound logistics activity concerns delivery to the end customers. In the marketing and sales area, the organisation needs to ‘Promote products’ and ‘Take orders’. Finally, the service activity involves providing support to customers presumably by answering queries and dealing with complaints. While the value chain was originally applied in a manufacturing context, it is possible to apply it to service organisations although this usually involves combining the operations and outbound logistics areas.  

## 7.4 Value Propositions:  

The definition of the value chain assumes that we understand the customers who purchase our goods and know what products or services they want. A value proposition is a definition of an organisation’s product or service that will demonstrate to customers that we understand and can satisfy their needs. Moreover, it differentiates organisations from their competitors. Unfortunately, many organisations produce poor value propositions which are bland descriptions of their products rather than being closely aligned with the needs of their customers.  

Kaplan and Norton (1992), the architects of the Balanced Scorecard, have identified the main attributes that make up successful value propositions. These are the drivers that lead to increased customer satisfaction, acquisition and retention. The proposition attributes cover three areas:  

- product/service attributes (functionality - price - quality - choice - availablity) that define the product itself;  
- customer relationship aspects;  
The customer relationship aspects will influence how a customer feels about purchasing from the organisation. For example, a supermarket chain may want to emphasise convenient access to their stores as well as knowledgeable staff who have the interests of the customer as their first consideration.  
- image and reputation aspects.  
The image may be that of the product, built up through extensive advertising and supported by the product attributes in order to generate customer loyalty. Thus a bottle of lager may be described as ‘reassuringly expensive’. Alternatively, a fashion retailer may develop an attractive image of the typical customer. Effectively, their message to their customers is ‘buy our clothes and be as attractive and successful as the image in the adverts’.  

It is useful to understand value propositions because they define what the organisation believes it needs to deliver to its customers, the business processes being the delivery mechanisms of the organisations’ value propositions.  

An organisation can differentiate itself in three ways:  

- by being the most efficient;  
Efficiency here means high volumes, low costs (and hence, low prices), for example, as provided by budget airlines.  
- by having the best products;  
Having the best products implies high quality but also innovation and the ability to introduce new products before the competition. Companies like Apple spring to mind here.  
- by providing the best customer service.  
High levels of customer service rely on flexibility which allows the product to be adaptable to the exact needs of the customer as well as staff that have the attitudes, training and freedom to understand and react to changing customer needs. The clearest examples are in the expensive end of the leisure industry which promises to exceed their customer’s needs.  

When conducting a business process improvement project, an understanding of the value proposition adopted by the organisation helps the analysts to understand the focus and objectives of the business processes. For example, where an organisation prides itself on excellent customer service, the processes delivering the service need to be designed to ensure that this is what is delivered.  

An alternative view of the value proposition is to consider the customer’s perspective. Customers usually know what they expect and will survey the industry to find the organisations that will meet their needs. An understanding of the customers’ value expectations helps us to consider whether, and if so how, they align with the organisational value proposition and can illuminate areas of the business processes that would benefit from improvement.  

## 7.5 Business Process Models:  

A business process is triggered by a business event and includes five key components: the tasks that make up the process, the process flow, the decision points, the actors that carry out the tasks and the outcome of the business process. Unfortunately, there is no universally agreed set of terms in business process modelling and the terms ‘process’, ‘activity’, ‘task’ and ‘step’ are often used interchangeably. For the sake of simplicity, we have adopted the following convention here:  

- ‘Process’ refers to an entire set of activities that start with a triggering event and end with some output being delivered.  
- ‘Task’ refers to an individual activity within the overall process; these are usually carried out by an actor at a single point in time.  
- ‘Step’ refers to the activities carried out within an individual task. It is useful to show just the tasks on the process model rather than each individual step as this helps with the readability and clarity of the model. Task descriptions can then be produced where the steps within each task can be defined.  

### Business Events:  
There are three types of business event:  

External – these business events originate from outside the organisation or the business system under consideration. For example, a customer makes a hotel booking or orders some goods.  
Internal – these business events originate within the business system and typically involve business managers making decisions. For example, the marketing manager makes a decision to reduce prices on a product line or the finance manager decides to review fees charged by suppliers.  
Time-based – these business events occur at a regular point in time. For example, a process to make salary payments to staff is initiated when it is the last working day of the month.  

### Developing the Business Process Model:  
During a process improvement project, it is common for the business analyst to produce an ‘as is’ model to show how the process works at the moment. Analysis of this ‘as is’ model will help to identify problems and weaknesses, leading to an improved version documented in the ‘to be’ process model.  

Two of the most popular standards are the UML activity diagram technique and the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN). Business process models are often called ‘swimlane diagrams’ because the ‘swimlanes’ showing all of the tasks performed by a defined ‘actor’, form a key element of the models. Here, we will use the notation and structure from the UML activity diagramming technique to build swimlane diagrams.  

To build a business process model, we first identify who takes part in the process. This enables us to identify the business ‘actors’ or ‘roles’. Actors may be individual people, a group of people or an organisation, or may be an IT system. The tasks carried out by each actor are shown in a separate band or ‘swimlane’ and arrows are used to show the flow of the work between the different swimlanes. Swimlanes usually appear on the diagram in the same sequence as the actors’ involvement in the process, although it is an informal convention that the customer swimlane is placed at the top. As a result, the action on the model goes from left to right on a horizontal layout, following the ‘time axis’ and top to bottom as the different actors get involved. To reinforce this representation of time, it is useful to show a process flow from Task A to Task B as follows:  

- the process flow arrow originating from the right-hand edge of Task A;  
- and ending at the left-hand edge of the Task B symbol.  

<img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/business-analysis-/9781780172774/images/figure7.10.jpg"><img>  
Actors =  Borrower - Librarian  
Task A -> Check availability of item  
Task B -> Send item to borrower  
Task C -> borrower receives item

There are two swimlanes for two actors. Top actor is where the process starts.  
There are two options available after checking availability - the diamond symbol (decision point) shows the decision point, the alternative flows with corresponding conditions, and the additional task required to handle this situation. he conditions under which the process takes each alternate route are indicated by placing a ‘guard expression’ in square brackets next to the flow lines.  
The implied left-to-right flow of time cannot always be shown on the model, however. If, for example, we want to show a task being carried out iteratively, we will have to include process flows going right-to-left or backwards; this does not mean they are going back in time but that the task is being repeated! This example of iteration is one situation where it may be convenient to show process flows going into and out of the upper and lower edges of the task symbol.  

<img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/business-analysis-/9781780172774/images/figure7.10.jpg"><img>  
The action that follows ‘Reserve item’ will be carried out in the ‘Accept returned item’ process from the higher-level model. Within this process there is a check each time a borrower returns an item. The check is made to determine whether or not another borrower has reserved the item. The librarian will recognise that the item is on the reserved list and will trigger the ‘Send item to borrower’ task in the ‘Loan item’ process to issue it to the reserving borrower.  

Keep symbols to a minimum to avoid confusion and result in minimal explanation being needed. It is best practice to construct the process or task name using the verb–noun format and the name should also describe what the process or task does. Where possible, use specific verbs, avoiding words such as ‘manage’ or ‘handle’. ‘Find book’ is a good example.  
Do not go into too much detail too quickly - the resulting model can quickly become too complicated. Start with the overall structure of the process and add detailed description later on.  
Start with:  
- where they get their input information from;  
- in general terms, what they do with it;  
- where they forward it after they have completed their work.  

A major advantage of a business process model is that each actor can easily see their contribution to the overall process. As discussed earlier, we are trying to provide a summarised view of the business process at this stage of the analysis. As a result, the tasks reveal minimum detail. A rule of thumb is to show a separate task for a piece of work done by an actor at a particular point in time. Each task should be shown as a single action, receiving an input from the preceding actor and handing over to the succeeding actor; this flow of work from one actor to another is known as a ‘hand-off’. It is important to analyse where this occurs as hand-offs often cause problems.  

#### Analysing Tasks:  
The swimlane diagram is sufficient to identify problems with the 'as-is' but more detail is needed. Analyse each task considering:  
- The trigger or business event that initiates the task.  
- Inputs to the task. This may include the trigger but there is also likely to be additional information required to carry out the task.  
- Outputs from the task.  
- Costs relevant to this particular task.  
- Measures and standards applicable to the task.  
- Detailed breakdown of steps within the task.  
- Business rules to be followed in performing the task.  

A textual description may suffice for many tasks but where the steps and business rules are more complex a diagram, such as a flowchart or UML activity diagram (without swimlanes), will be much more useful.  

#### Hierarchy of Process Models:  
The set of process models – from organisation-level to swimlane diagram to task analysis – provides an organised, clear definition of the business processes and procedures. This multileveled approach to business process modelling will necessitate an iterative approach to the analysis. As the lower level task analyses reveal more detail, it is inevitable that the higher level business process models will have to be updated.  

#### Beginning and Ending the Process:  
Usually it is the initiator (who triggers an event) shown at the top of the swimlane model. If a task is completed by two actors (A customer and the call centre sales person are working together to record the order details) then the task is shown between the boundary of both swimlanes.  

The end of the process is a bullseye symbol. As a guideline, there should be a separate end for each significant end state. Some modellers label the end symbol with the name of its state.  

## 7.6 Analysing the 'as is' Process:  

Businesses evolve over time. The internal organisation and people within the business change. The customers and the products we sell them change. As a result, processes are constantly changing to reflect the different environment in which they operate. Unfortunately, many of these changes occur in an ad hoc and uncontrolled way. When we formally model a process, we start to see how messy and incoherent they have become. Many people are surprised when they first see the swimlane diagram of the process on which they work. Whilst they are familiar with their own part of the process, they may have little idea of what the whole process does, how it works and where their work fits within it.  

### Identifying Problems:  
In order to identify problems with an 'as is' process, we need to find out how well it supports the business.   
- Are the customer-facing processes good enough to satisfy the customers and ensure that they come back and spend more money? The ordering process must be fast, accurate and efficient so that it does not cost too much.  
For analysis purposes, we need to know exactly what such terms actually mean.  
- How quickly do we need to deliver the goods to the customer if we are to retain their loyalty?  
- How much should it cost the business to handle an order?  
Once we have determined the required performance levels, the next step is to compare them with the actual performance of the existing process. Information about the required and actual performance levels may not be easily available which can suggest several problems. However, it is worth persevering in order to obtain this information. A gap between the actual and required performance levels indicates the need for improvements. We can use the ‘as is’ model as a basis for analysing why the performance targets are not being achieved. There are two key aspects of the model we need to examine, the hand-offs between the tasks and the tasks themselves.  

### Analysing the Hand Offs:  
One of the frequent problems found with business processes involve ‘hand-offs’, where one actor passes the work to another actor.  
Swimlanes allow for clear representation of hand-offs and is particularly beneficial when we are trying to improve processes. Hand-offs account for many of the problems experienced by traditional processes as they can cause delays, communication errors and bottlenecks to occur.  
The task may join a queue and not be dealt with immediately or the information might not be passed on correctly on handover. A further cause of delays at hand-offs is where there is inadequate resource capacity to handle the throughput and queues develop.  

Analysis of the ‘as is’ processes commonly shows that transactions spend more than 70 per cent of the elapsed time simply waiting to be processed. It has even been estimated that, in some processes, the transactions are being actively processed for less than 10 per cent of the elapsed time, with more than 90 per cent of the time spent in transit or in queues. Queues form at hand-offs because the two actors have not synchronised their work. In some situations, attempts to optimise work in one task can actually make the performance of the whole process worse.  

There are other problems with hand-offs, often occurring because the transaction is going from one IT system to another. Problems occur where the data issued by the sending system needs to be reformatted to suit the needs of the receiving software. This not only takes time and effort but can also introduce errors.  

### Analysing the Processing:  
The ‘as is’ processes may have been in use for some considerable time and during this period they may have changed, reacting to changing business needs. As a result, they may contain significant inefficiencies and inconsistencies. When analysing business processes it is important to look for the following possibilities:  

- Duplication of work. Some tasks may be carried out despite the fact that they duplicate other actors’ tasks or record the same information.  
- Redundancy. Work and/or data that was necessary when the process was first designed may no longer be required.  
- Lack of standardisation. Previously, organisations were less aware of the need for effective processes and hence there was less emphasis on carrying out processes in a standard way. Remote locations such as branch offices and depots were allowed flexibility in the way that they interpreted and implemented their processes. This may have worked in a decentralised business but now that there is greater control and centralisation, all the different parts of the business are expected to operate in an integrated fashion.  
- Incompleteness. New requirements may have been identified of the process since its original design. These may have been ignored because they were too difficult or costly to incorporate in the existing process or they may have been handled by a work-around.  
- Inconsistent measurement or control. The business process approach has increased the emphasis on measuring the standard of work and the service provided to customers. Where a process has developed over time the measures may not be relevant or may be inconsistent with other measures.  

If any of these situations are encountered, the analyst needs to apply business process modelling and improvement approaches in order to rectify the situation.  

### Other Factors Causing Inadequate Performance of a Process:  
Even if a process is perfectly designed, however, this does not guarantee that the process will achieve its performance objectives. There are various reasons why this might be the case:  

- The staff working on the process may not have the right skills, training and motivation to produce the desired results.  
- The resources made available to run the process may be insufficient to handle the volume of transactions received. This could include both staff and equipment resources.  
- The process may not be managed appropriately. This is a particular problem when a process crosses many organisational boundaries and there is no single owner to manage the whole process.  

## 7.7 Improving Business Processes:  

- remove problems identified in 'as-is'  
- decide if this is the real problem  

Our initial analysis, for example, might have identified that our invoice production is taking too long and we are missing deadlines for billing our customers. One solution to this could be to allocate more resources to the processing to speed it up. Further analysis, however, might reveal that the real cause of the delay is excessive rework. A more appropriate solution to this situation would be to implement tighter controls, reduce the rework and eliminate the delays without incurring the cost of increased resources.  

### Business Rules:  

Business process improvement is also about challenging the assumptions and business rules upon which the current process is built and which, in some circumstances, may limit the process. Business rules are categorised in two ways:  

- Constraints – these are the business rules that have to be applied and restrict how a process or task is performed. The constraints may be enforced upon the organisation, such as legal or regulatory constraints. Alternatively, they may result from internal policies or strategies.  
- Operational guidance – these are the business rules that determine how procedures are conducted within the organisation. For example, there may be rules governing cancellation fees for hotel bookings or postage charges for delivering orders.  

### Simplify the Process:  

- eliminate unnecessary/redundant tasks or hand-offs  
- combine tasks to a single actor where possible  
- if a task does not add value or enable another part of the process to add value then it should eliminated  
- where workarounds have been devloped a standard way of doing things should be intorduced  
- remove bottlenecks (it can be useful to use sophisticated process modelling tools as they provide simulation facilities that help us examine the performance and resource requirements of proposed process designs)  
- update the sequence of tasks  
- update the boundary of processes (extend or reduce the activities carried out by the organisation). For example, where order processing staff are replaced with an online booking system or access is provided to electronic documentation. OR A distribution company supplying goods to retailers would traditionally require those retailers to submit their replenishment orders as and when their stocks got low. If the distributor were given access to retailers’ sales data, they could then maintain the retailers’ stock without any action on the retailers part. Not only would this make life easier for the retailer but the distributor would have better information for planning their own stock levels.  
- automate! (faster, cheaper, more reliable, standardised)  
-> Bespoke IT development. The definition of the business process provides an excellent basis on which to define the detailed requirements of a bespoke IT solution.  
-> Packaged applications. These provide best practice processes for specific areas such as Finance or HR. Examples are the ERP packages supplied by organisations such as SAP and Oracle.  
-> Workflow management systems. Essentially this is software that controls the flow of electronic documents/transactions through the various tasks of a process. It can ‘read’ the process model to determine exactly what should happen during a transaction, depending on particular circumstances.  
-> Straight through processing (STP). This as a concept from the finance industry that allows transactions to be passed from one ‘party’ to another without any manual intervention and is used to integrate the work of front, middle and back office functions.  
- Redesign the process (devlop 'as-is' model -> analyse 'as-is' and define problems -> identify potential improvements -> document 'to-be' model)  
- if there is no existing process or it is so different from what the organisation wants to become the a direct creation of 'to-be' must be made  
- The organisation model, the value chain and the value proposition will reveal the aims of the business and the environment within which the process needs to be implemented (strategic plans, business objective and relevant KPIs also help)  

- Model the to-be' defining the expected outcomes of the process and the events/triggers that the process will need to respond to  
- work backwards from expected outcomes - detwrmine logical tasks needed to achieve these outcomes  
- if the planned organisational structure is known then tasks can eba ssigned to relevant swimlanes  
- even if the existing process is not relevant it is useful to analyse to identify underlying business rules that may need to be carried over and to plan where the changeover will begin and where it will end  

- define not only what the process does but also how well that processing is to be carried out  
- there are two perspectives on performance measurement: measurement for internal management purposes and measurement by our external customers  

Internal Measures:  
- organisational objectives, CSFs and PKIs
- defined at organisational level, cascaded down to departmental level and then further to the operational level  
- internal measures are often focused on what the organisation wants to achieve and not on what the customer values (ie low cost operation as a KPI can cause porblems for the successful delivery of the services)  

External Measures:  
- what the customer expects to have delivered (what the customer values)  
- areas to consider: time to complete a task -> cost/prices (financial) -> accuracy/effectiveness (quality)  

Performance and Task Measures:  
- key issue is to understand customers' value expectations  
- process amy be made up of serveral tasks, all of which needs to be measured for performance (this should be aggregated within the overall performance measures)  
- performance targets for a process must align with the expectations of the customers  
- estimating timelines depends on the following:  
-> length of each task within the process  
-> resources available  
-> number of transactions to be processed  
-> variety of transactions  
-> errors causing rework  
-> delays and queues at hand-offs  
-> quality and productivity of staff  

- process modelling software can provide performance information to simulate the behaviour using the data above  
- cost and time are interrelated (the longer it takes the more it costs)  

Performance Issues:  
- measures and targets must be carfeully chosen (especially when incentives are involved)  
- the implications of the target must be thought through (increasing sales target leading to lowering prices to meet targets)  

### Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN):  
- standardised way of drawing BPMs  
- represents BPMs in an industry-standard way  
- precise logic that can be understood and executed by workflow or process engines that control many business processes  

- similar to UML (swimlanes) with additional notation:  
-> POOL - consists of lanes (process shows sequence of task carried out by actors each in their own lane)  
-> blackbox pool - external actor (customer who initiates the process) no activities shown in this lane/pool  
-> GATEWAY - controls the flow through the tasks (represented as a diamond - letter 'O' inside = either/or decision, '+' inside = parallel process flow)  

### Six Sigma:  
Its purpose is to eradicate performance deficiencies in processes that are critical to achieving customer satisfaction. These processes might include complaint handling, order fulfilment or delivering a package to a customer’s house. To achieve process improvement, Six Sigma follows a five step approach known as DMAIC:  

- **Define** the problem. What is going wrong? Is it one problem or many? What is the visible evidence? Where is it and where does it come from? How serious is it? Is it organisation wide or localised? What will be done about it? What is the objective of this investigation?  

- **Measure** the data. This means obtaining the data to identify the symptoms; do they occur all the time or from time to time? Produce a map of the process that is producing the problem. Concentrate on the symptoms doing the most damage.  

- **Analyse** the results so far. Be creative and prepare theories about the causes of the problems. Document the theories and test them. Identify the root causes.  

- **Improve** the process. Assess alternative improvement methods. Design and test the chosen method. Implement the chosen method.  

- **Control** the new process and monitor its effectiveness.
