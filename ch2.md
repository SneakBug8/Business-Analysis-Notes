- **Personal qualities** are concerned with how you think and how you interact with the people around you. They are not specific to business analysis but are general skills that are important for developing and progressing in any business environment. Behavioural skills are arguably more important than technical or business skills as they are a prerequisite for working with other people.  
- A BA also requires **business knowledge** which helps to develop a good understanding of their organisation and the business domain or sector within which it operates. This knowledge is vital if the business analyst is to offer advice and insights that will help improve the organisationâ€™s performance.
