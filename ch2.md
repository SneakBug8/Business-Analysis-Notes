<img src="https://busyanalyst.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/picture2.jpg"><img>

## Personal Qualities:  

- **Personal qualities** are concerned with how you think and how you interact with the people around you. They are not specific to business analysis but are general skills that are important for developing and progressing in any business environment. Behavioural skills are arguably more important than technical or business skills as they are a prerequisite for working with other people.  
- A BA also requires **business knowledge** which helps to develop a good understanding of their organisation and the business domain or sector within which it operates. This knowledge is vital if the business analyst is to offer advice and insights that will help improve the organisation’s performance.  
 
COMMUNICATION:  
- Most important skill  
- Encompasses a wide range of areas such as building rapport, listening, influencing and building empathy.  
- Poor communication skills are often cited as the root cause of problems during discussions between business and IT staff.  
- It is vital to communicate with business colleagues in a language and style they are comfortable with and avoid unfamiliar terms and references.  

RELATIONSHIP BUILDING:  
- Getting on with others  
- Some people seem to possess this ability naturally, others have to work at it but either way it is essential for a BA.  
- As a BA you need to get people to impart information and share opinions with you, and also to discuss ideas for change. All of these things will be easier if the people concerned like and trust you.  
- Demonstrate a genuine interest in the other person and offer open discussions which build mutual trust and respect.  

INFLUENCING:  
- If a BA's conclusions are at odds with preconceived ideas about what is required or if it calls for radical or unexpected action, then the ability to influence is essential.  
- Identifying the stakeholders and understanding the amount of power they exert over the decision-making processes will allow you to target and influence the decision-makers most effectively.  
- BAs have to develop an understanding of where the other party stands on their proposal, any likely resistance and the influencing style needed to approach the person or group.  
TEAMWORK:  
- The nature of business analysis work requires collecting information from and collaborating with many groups such as business colleagues, suppliers, project team members and management.  
- Key factors for consideration are vision, commitment, trust, capability, accountability, principles, creativity, responsiveness and recognition.  

POLITICAL AWARENESS:  
- Essentially, this means the ability to work out what is and is not politically acceptable in an organisation and being able to use the right organisational levers to get things done.  
- This requires an analyst to know the sources of power and information within the organisation, understanding what is acceptable or not, and tailoring the approach accordingly.  
ANALYTICAL SKILLS AND CRITICAL THINKING:  
- Involves challenging received wisdom at every turn: Why do you do this? What value does it add? Where is it done? How is it done? Who is or should be responsible? When should it happen? Is there another way to do this?  
- One maxim often used is to conduct 20 per cent of the analysis in order to achieve 80 per cent of the right answer – and then be 100 per cent convincing when influencing the outcome.  
- This means recognising the key factors and the imposed constraints rather than trying to analyse everything.  

ATTENTION TO DETAIL:  
- Several aspects of the BA’s work require detailed investigation.  
- The key competence here is to have an attention to detail when necessary and to be able to identify when this is required.  

PROBLEM SOLVING:  
- There is a need for a problem-solving mindset, requiring curiosity, tenacity and analytical ability plus an open mind that seeks out and evaluates options. Pragmatism is also key to successful problem solving.  

LEADERSHIP:  
- Getting the vision and actions right requires holistic thinking and rigorous analysis, and positions the project for success with key business stakeholders.  
- Different levels of leadership – self, project, organisation and wider world – have been recognised with regard to the business analyst role.  

SELF-BELIEF:  
- Having sufficient self-confidence – in yourself, in the quality of your analysis, in the relevance of your approach – to be able to withstand pressure, challenge proposals, analyse impacts and sustain your arguments. Self-belief is a key competence for working effectively with stakeholders across the broad range of situations.  

## Business Knowledge:  

BUSINESS FINANCE AND BUSINESS CASE DEVELOPMENT:  
- Whether working in the commercial, government or non-profit sectors of the economy, finance plays a key role in deciding what funds are available and what can and cannot be done.  
-A  general understanding of aspects such as the balance sheet and income statement (profit and loss account), financial analysis tools like ratio analysis, budgeting and cash flow, the nature of profit or surplus, and the principles of costing products and services.  
- BAs need to disregard costly options quickly, and ensure that they deliver value from their analysis work.  

DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE:  
- Having a good understanding of the domain/sector in which your organisation operates.  
- Enables a BA to use familiar language, understand what would and would not be acceptable or useful and some ideas and experiences may be applicable in other domains.  

SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTISE:  
- A good understanding of the terminology, processes and constraints is important to establish credibility with the customer.  
- Enables BAs to communicate more easily with the business staff and identify potential areas for change or further analysis.  

IT PRINCIPLES:  
- The original conception of business analysis was as a ‘bridging’ role, enabling the communication between the business and IT staff.  
- A general understanding of IT and software development approaches is necessary so that business analysts can communicate meaningfully with the IT professionals and appreciate their role and contribution to the systems development process.
