### Business Change Solutions:  
- development of new systems  
- improvement/enhancement of exisiting systems  

#### BA role has developed as a result of 3 key areas:  
### 1. Impact of outsourcing  
- IT is usually outsourced. This is a mutually beneficial arrangement (IT company gains a client and the business gains specialised services)  
- **WHY?** reduces cost and there is often a lack of IT expertise within a business  
- Issues arise when the IT provider cannot meet the needs of the business  
- The BA bridges the gap in communication  

### 2. Competetive advantage of using IT  
- IT systems are driven by the businesses needs  
- The requirements must be precise to meet the business needs  

### 3. Succesful business change  
- BAs uncover the causes of business problems, identify issues to address and ensure suggested solutions align with the businesses needs.  

## The competencies of a Business Analyst  

- Some business analysts were previously experienced IT systems analysts and proved less comfortable considering the business requirements and the range of potential solutions that would meet the requirements.  
- Many business analysts have a business background and have a limited understanding of IT and how software is developed. While knowledge of the business is invaluable for business analysts, problems can occur where IT forms part of the business solution and the analyst has insufficient understanding of IT. This may cause communication difficulties with the developers and could result in failure to ensure that there is an integrated view of the business and IT system.  
**Therefore** an excellent BA has BOTH business knowledge and IT knowledge
