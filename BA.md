## What is Business Analysis?  

`Individual responsible for ensuring that the proposed business change solutions are aligned with the eneds of the business.`  
`An advisory role which has the responsibility for investigating and analysing business situations, identifying and evaluating options for improving business systems, elaborating and defining requirements, and ensuring the effective implementation and use of information systems in line with the needs of the business.`

The questions being asked by businesses are:  
` ‘What can IT do to exploit business opportunities and enhance the portfolio of products and services?’`  
and  
`‘What needs to change in the organisation if the benefits from a new or enhanced IT system are to be realised?’`  


### Business Change Solutions:  
- development of new systems  
- improvement/enhancement of exisiting systems  

#### BA role has developed as a result of 3 key areas:  
### 1. Impact of outsourcing  
- IT is usually outsourced. This is a mutually beneficial arrangement (IT company gains a client and the business gains specialised services)  
- **WHY?** reduces cost and there is often a lack of IT expertise within a business  
- Issues arise when the IT provider cannot meet the needs of the business  
- The BA bridges the gap in communication  

### 2. Competetive advantage of using IT  
- IT systems must be driven by the business' needs  
- Implementation of IT must be accompanied by the necessary business changes
- The requirements must be precise and accurate    

### 3. Succesful business change  
- BAs uncover the causes of business problems, identify issues to address and ensure suggested solutions align with the businesses needs.  

#### Business Change Lifecycle:

### Alignment and Definisiton stages involve:  
- Analysis of the organisation  
- Its business needs  
- The requirements which determine new ways to improve effectiveness and efficiency of the business

### Subsequent stages involve:  
- Change, design and development  
- Business acceptance testing  
- Implementation of new IT systems  
- Realisation of business benefits  

The analysis portion of the BCL falls to the BA.  
Issues arise if the BA is not involved in this:  
- definition of business needs and requirements for meeting these needs are often unclear and not aligned  

- It is critical to ensure that the focus is on understanding the problems that are to be addressed rather than on IT solutions to be developed  
- All too often the focus almost from the outset is on the solution rather than understanding what problem we are trying to address.  
- A lack of clarity on the issues can result in failure to deliver business beefits and wastage of invested resources.

## The competencies of a Business Analyst  

- Some business analysts were previously experienced IT systems analysts and proved less comfortable considering the business requirements and the range of potential solutions that would meet the requirements.  
- Many business analysts have a business background and have a limited understanding of IT and how software is developed. While knowledge of the business is invaluable for business analysts, problems can occur where IT forms part of the business solution and the analyst has insufficient understanding of IT. This may cause communication difficulties with the developers and could result in failure to ensure that there is an integrated view of the business and IT system.  

**Therefore** an excellent BA has BOTH business knowledge and IT knowledge  

### Range of analysis activities:  
- Strategic Analysis and Definition  
Some BAs may be required to undertake strategic analysis and identify business transformation actions, but it is more likely that they will have a role to play in supporting this activity. However, BAs are expected to have access to information about their organisation’s business strategy and be able to understand it, as their work will need to support the execution of this strategy. BAs will need a good understanding of how strategy is developed and the impact upon the work of the IT and business change functions.  

- IT Systems Analysis  
Some organisations consider this work to be of such a technical nature that they perceive it to be completely outside the province of the BA and have separated the business analysis and IT teams into different departments, expecting the IT department to carry out the detailed IT systems modelling and specification. Others differentiate between IT BAs and ‘business’ business analysts, with those in IT often performing a role more akin to that of a systems analyst. In order to do this, the BAs need a detailed understanding of IT systems and how they operate, and must be able to use the approaches and modelling techniques that fell historically within the remit of the system analyst role.  

- Business Analysis  
The gap between the two is straddled by the BA. BAs will usually be required to investigate a business system where improvements are required but the range and focus of those improvements can vary considerably.  

POPIT shows the different views that must be considered when identifying areas for improving the business system.

#### The processes:  
Are they well defined and communicated? Is there good IT support or are there several ‘work-arounds’ in existence? Does the process require documents to be passed around the organisation unnecessarily? Is there the potential for delays or the introduction of errors?  
#### The people  
Do they have the required skills for the job? How motivated are they? Do they understand the business objectives that they need to support?  
#### The organisation  
Is there a supportive management style? Are jobs and responsibilities well defined? Is there collaborative cross-functional working?  
#### The information  
Do the staff have the information to conduct their work effectively? Are managers able to make decisions based on accurate and timely information?  
#### The technology  
Do the systems support the business as required? Do they provide the information needed to run the organisation?  

## Roles and Responsibilities:  
Although there are different role definitions, depending upon the organisation, there does seem to be an area of common ground where most business analysts work. These core responsibilities are:  
- Investigate business systems taking a holistic view of the situation; this may include examining elements of the organisation structures and staff development issues as well as current processes and IT systems.  
- Evaluate actions to improve the operation of a business system. Again, this may require an examination of organisational structure and staff development needs, to ensure that they are in line with any proposed process redesign and IT system development.  
- Document the business requirements for the IT system support using appropriate documentation standards.  
- Elaborate requirements, in support of the business users, during evolutionary system development.  

Some business analysis roles extend into other areas, possibly the strategic analysis or systems analysis activities described above. This may be where business analysts are in a more senior role or choose to specialise. These areas are:  
- Strategy implementation – here the business analysts work closely with senior management to help define the most effective business system to implement elements of the business strategy.  
- Business case production – more senior business analysts usually do this, typically with assistance from Finance specialists.  
- Benefits realisation – the business analysts carry out post-implementation reviews, examine the benefits defined in the business case and evaluate whether or not the benefits have been achieved. Actions to achieve the business benefits are also identified and sometimes carried out by the business analysts.  
- Specification of IT requirements – typically using standard modelling techniques such as data modelling or use case modelling.  

The rationale for business analysis is:  
- Root causes not symptoms  
- To distinguish between the symptoms of problems and the root causes  
- To investigate and address the root causes of business problems  
- To consider the holistic viewBusiness improvement not IT change  
- To recognise that IT systems should enable business opportunity or problem resolution  
- To analyse opportunities for business improvement  
- To enable business agilityOptions not solutions  
- To challenge pre-determined solutions  
- To identify and evaluate options for meeting business needs  
- Feasible, contributing requirements not meeting all requests  
- To be aware of financial and timescale constraints  
- To identify requirements that are not feasible and do not contribute to business objectives  
- To evaluate stated requirements against business needs and constraints  
- The entire business change lifecycle not just requirements definition  
- To analyse business situations  
- To support the effective development, testing, deployment and post-implementation review of solutions  
- To support the management and realisation of business benefits  
- Negotiation not avoidanceTo recognise conflicting stakeholder views and requirements  
- To negotiate conflicts between stakeholders  

#### Business Analysis Maturity Model:  
<img src="https://www.assistkd.com/sites/default/files/paragraph/image/bamm.jpg"><img> 
- The **scope** may be very specific if an initial study has identified the required course of action and the analyst now needs to explore and define solution in greater detail. Alternatively, the scope may have been defined at only an overview level, or may be very ambiguous, with the business analyst having to carry out detailed investigation to uncover the issues before the options can be explored.  
- The level of **authority** of the BA can also vary considerably, from a limited level of authority to the ability to influence and guide at senior management level.  
- The **first level** is where the business analysis work is concerned with defining the requirements for an IT system improvement. At this level, the scope is likely to be well-defined and the level of authority limited to the project on which the business analyst works.  
- The **next level** is where the business analysis work has moved beyond a specific IT development so that the analysts work cross-functionally to improve the business processes that give rise to the requirements.  
- The **third level** is where the scope and authority of the analysts are at their greatest. Here, the business analysis work is concerned with improving the business and working with senior management to support the delivery of value to customers.
