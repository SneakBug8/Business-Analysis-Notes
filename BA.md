The questions being asked by businesses are:  
` ‘What can IT do to exploit business opportunities and enhance the portfolio of products and services?’`  
and  
`‘What needs to change in the organisation if the benefits from a new or enhanced IT system are to be realised?’`  


### Business Change Solutions:  
- development of new systems  
- improvement/enhancement of exisiting systems  

#### BA role has developed as a result of 3 key areas:  
### 1. Impact of outsourcing  
- IT is usually outsourced. This is a mutually beneficial arrangement (IT company gains a client and the business gains specialised services)  
- **WHY?** reduces cost and there is often a lack of IT expertise within a business  
- Issues arise when the IT provider cannot meet the needs of the business  
- The BA bridges the gap in communication  

### 2. Competetive advantage of using IT  
- IT systems must be driven by the business' needs  
- Implementation of IT must be accompanied by the necessary business changes
- The requirements must be precise and accurate    

### 3. Succesful business change  
- BAs uncover the causes of business problems, identify issues to address and ensure suggested solutions align with the businesses needs.  

#### Business Change Lifecycle:

### Alignment and Definisiton stages involve:  
- Analysis of the organisation  
- Its business needs  
- The requirements which determine new ways to improve effectiveness and efficiency of the business

### Subsequent stages involve:  
- Change, design and development  
- Business acceptance testing  
- Implementation of new IT systems  
- Realisation of business benefits  

The analysis portion of the BCL falls to the BA.  
Issues arise if the BA is not involved in this:  
- definition of business needs and requirements for meeting these needs are often unclear and not aligned  

It is critical to ensure that the focus is on understanding the problems that are to be addressed rather than on IT solutions to be developed  

A lack of clarity on the issues can result in failure to deliver business beefits and wastage of invested resources.

## The competencies of a Business Analyst  

- Some business analysts were previously experienced IT systems analysts and proved less comfortable considering the business requirements and the range of potential solutions that would meet the requirements.  
- Many business analysts have a business background and have a limited understanding of IT and how software is developed. While knowledge of the business is invaluable for business analysts, problems can occur where IT forms part of the business solution and the analyst has insufficient understanding of IT. This may cause communication difficulties with the developers and could result in failure to ensure that there is an integrated view of the business and IT system.  
**Therefore** an excellent BA has BOTH business knowledge and IT knowledge
