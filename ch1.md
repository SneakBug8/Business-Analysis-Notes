# What is Business Analysis?  

## 1.1 The Origins of Business Analysis:  

`Individual responsible for ensuring that the proposed business change solutions are aligned with the needs of the business.`  

`An advisory role which has the responsibility for investigating and analysing business situations, identifying and evaluating options for improving business systems, elaborating and defining requirements, and ensuring the effective implementation and use of information systems in line with the needs of the business.`

`Business Analysis is the practice of enabling change in an organizational context, by defining needs and recommending solutions that deliver value to stakeholders. - IIBA`  

`Identifying business needs. Recommending relevant solutions. Working with stakeholders to elicit requirements. Analyzing, defining, documenting and managing requirements. BAs help to shape the outcome of projects to ensure they deliver business benefits. - PMI`

The questions being asked by businesses are:  
` ‘What can IT do to exploit business opportunities and enhance the portfolio of products and services?’`  
and  
`‘What needs to change in the organisation if the benefits from a new or enhanced IT system are to be realised?’`  

### Business Change Solutions:  
- development of new systems  
- improvement/enhancement of exisiting systems  

## 1.2 The Development of Business Analysis:  

### BA role has developed as a result of 3 key areas:  
#### 1. Impact of outsourcing  
- IT is usually outsourced. This is a mutually beneficial arrangement (IT company gains a client and the business gains specialised services)  
- **WHY?** -> reduces cost and there is often a lack of IT expertise within a business  
- Issues arise when the IT provider cannot meet the needs of the business  
- The BA bridges the gap in communication  

#### 2. Competetive advantage of using IT  
- IT systems must be driven by the business' needs  
- Implementation of IT must be accompanied by the necessary business changes
- The requirements must be precise and accurate    

#### 3. Successful business change  
- Roles and skill sets need to enable the successful delivery of business change initiatives.  
- BAs uncover the causes of business problems, identify issues to address and ensure suggested solutions align with the businesses needs.  

### Business Change Lifecycle:

#### Alignment and Definititon stages involve:  
- Analysis of the organisation and its business needs  
- The requirements which determine new ways to improve effectiveness and efficiency of the business

#### Subsequent stages involve:  
- Change design and development  
- Business acceptance testing  
- Implementation of new IT systems (post implementation)  
- Realisation of business benefits  

### The importance of a BA:  
The analysis portion of the BCL falls to the BA.  
Issues arise if the BA is not involved in this:  
- Definition of business needs and requirements for meeting these needs are often unclear and not aligned  
- It is critical to ensure that the focus is on understanding the problems that are to be addressed rather than on IT solutions to be developed  
- All too often the focus almost from the outset is on the solution rather than understanding what problem we are trying to address.  
- A lack of clarity on the issues can result in failure to deliver business beefits and wastage of invested resources.

### The competencies of a BA:  
- Some business analysts were previously experienced IT systems analysts and proved less comfortable considering the business requirements and the range of potential solutions that would meet the requirements.  
- Many business analysts have a business background and have a limited understanding of IT and how software is developed. While knowledge of the business is invaluable for business analysts, problems can occur where IT forms part of the business solution and the analyst has insufficient understanding of IT. This may cause communication difficulties with the developers and could result in failure to ensure that there is an integrated view of the business and IT system.  

**Therefore** an excellent BA has BOTH business knowledge and IT knowledge.  

## 1.3 The Scope of Business Analysis Work:  

### Range of analysis activities:  
- Strategic Analysis and Definition:  
Some BAs may be required to undertake strategic analysis and identify business transformation actions, but it is more likely that they will have a role to play in supporting this activity. However, BAs are expected to have access to information about their organisation’s business strategy and be able to understand it, as their work will need to support the execution of this strategy. BAs will need a good understanding of how strategy is developed and the impact upon the work of the IT and business change functions.  

- IT Systems Analysis:  
Some organisations consider this work to be of such a technical nature that they perceive it to be completely outside the province of the BA and have separated the business analysis and IT teams into different departments, expecting the IT department to carry out the detailed IT systems modelling and specification. Others differentiate between IT BAs and ‘business’ BAs, with those in IT often performing a role more akin to that of a systems analyst. In order to do this, the BAs need a detailed understanding of IT systems and how they operate, and must be able to use the approaches and modelling techniques that fell historically within the remit of the system analyst role. Where an Agile approach has been adopted for a software development project, the BA will work closely with the end users and development team to clarify the detailed requirements as they evolve during the devlopment process.  

- Business Analysis:  
The gap between the two is straddled by the BA. BAs will usually be required to investigate a business system where improvements are required but the range and focus of those improvements can vary considerably. It may be a localised issue or a broader study, with investigation into several issues where a rigorous business case would need to support any recommendations. It may be the enhancement or replacement of an existing IT system where a requirements document would need to be provided, defining what the IT system would need to provide.   

## Taking a Holistic Approach:  

### The Scope of BA work:  
Organisations are placing increasing emphasis upon ensuring that there is a rigorous business case to justify the expenditure on business improvement projects. The focus on the management and realisation of these business benefits, once the solution has been delivered, is also growing. Ensuring that changes are assessed in terms of the impact upon the business case and, post implementation, supporting the assessment of whether or not predicted business benefits have been realised, is a key element of the role.  

Although the BA performs a key role in supporting management’s exploitation of IT to obtain business benefit, this has to be within the context of the entire business system. All aspects of the operational business system need to be analysed if all of the opportunities for business improvement are to be uncovered.  

**POPIT** shows the different views that must be considered when identifying areas for improving the business system.

#### The processes:  
Are they well defined and communicated? Is there good IT support or are there several ‘work-arounds’ in existence? Does the process require documents to be passed around the organisation unnecessarily? Is there the potential for delays or the introduction of errors?  
#### The people  
Do they have the required skills for the job? How motivated are they? Do they understand the business objectives that they need to support?  
#### The organisation  
Is there a supportive management style? Are jobs and responsibilities well defined? Is there collaborative cross-functional working?  
#### The information  
Do the staff have the information to conduct their work effectively? Are managers able to make decisions based on accurate and timely information?  
#### The technology  
Do the systems support the business as required? Do they provide the information needed to run the organisation?  

##### Agile:  
The Agile philosophy is to deliver software increments early and to elaborate requirements using approaches such as prototyping. The use of such approaches evolved as a reaction to the linear waterfall lifecycle, with its emphasis on completing a stage before moving on to the next stage.

The BA will be involved in supporting the business users in clarifying, elaborating and prioritising the requirements during the development process. The BA brings domain expertise and analytical ability to the development team, assisting the users by assessing the impact of proposed functionality in the light of the strategic business context.  

## 1.5 The Role and Responsibilities of a Business Analyst:  

### Roles and Responsibilities:  
Although there are different role definitions, depending upon the organisation, there does seem to be an area of common ground where most BAs work. These core responsibilities are:  
- Investigate business systems taking a holistic view of the situation; this may include examining elements of the organisation structures and staff development issues as well as current processes and IT systems.  
- Evaluate actions to improve the operation of a business system. Again, this may require an examination of organisational structure and staff development needs, to ensure that they are in line with any proposed process redesign and IT system development.  
- Document the business requirements for the IT system support using appropriate documentation standards.  
- Elaborate requirements, in support of the business users, during evolutionary system development.  

**Core role of a BA:**  
```
An advisory role which has the responsibility for investigating and analysing business situations, identifying and evaluating options for improving business systems,
elaborating and defining requirements, and ensuring the effective implementation and use of information systems in line with the needs of the business.
```

Some business analysis roles extend into other areas, possibly the strategic analysis or systems analysis activities described above. This may be where business analysts are in a more senior role or choose to specialise. These areas are:  
- Strategy implementation – here the BAs work closely with senior management to help define the most effective business system to implement elements of the business strategy.  
- Business case production – more senior BAs usually do this, typically with assistance from finance specialists.  
- Benefits realisation – the BAs carry out post-implementation reviews, examine the benefits defined in the business case and evaluate whether or not the benefits have been achieved. Actions to achieve the business benefits are also identified and sometimes carried out by the BAs.  
- Specification of IT requirements – typically using standard modelling techniques such as data modelling or use case modelling.  

Additional support from the BA may include the following:  
- developing test scenarios for business acceptance testing  
- writing procedure manuals and user guides  
- training business staff in the use of the new processes and IT systems  
- defining job roles and writing job role descriptions  
- providing ongoing support as the business staff begin to adopt the new, unfamiliar, approaches  

The rationale for business analysis is:  
**Root causes not symptoms:**  
- To distinguish between the symptoms of problems and the root causes  
- To investigate and address the root causes of business problems  
- To consider the holistic view  
**Business improvement not IT change:**  
- To recognise that IT systems should enable business opportunity or problem resolution  
- To analyse opportunities for business improvement  
- To enable business agility  
**Options not solutions:**  
- To challenge pre-determined solutions  
- To identify and evaluate options for meeting business needs  
**Feasible, contributing requirements not meeting all requests:**  
- To be aware of financial and timescale constraints  
- To identify requirements that are not feasible and do not contribute to business objectives  
- To evaluate stated requirements against business needs and constraints  
**The entire business change lifecycle not just requirements definition:**  
- To analyse business situations  
- To support the effective development, testing, deployment and post-implementation review of solutions  
- To support the management and realisation of business benefits  
**Negotiation not avoidance:**  
- To recognise conflicting stakeholder views and requirements  
- To negotiate conflicts between stakeholders  

### Business Analysis Maturity Model:  
<img src="https://www.assistkd.com/sites/default/files/paragraph/image/bamm.jpg"><img>  

- The **scope** may be very specific if an initial study has identified the required course of action and the analyst now needs to explore and define solution in greater detail. Alternatively, the scope may have been defined at only an overview level, or may be very ambiguous, with the business analyst having to carry out detailed investigation to uncover the issues before the options can be explored.  
- The level of **authority** of the BA can also vary considerably, from a limited level of authority to the ability to influence and guide at senior management level.  
- The **first level** is where the business analysis work is concerned with defining the requirements for an IT system improvement. At this level, the scope is likely to be well-defined and the level of authority limited to the project on which the business analyst works.  
- The **next level** is where the business analysis work has moved beyond a specific IT development so that the analysts work cross-functionally to improve the business processes that give rise to the requirements.  
- The **third level** is where the scope and authority of the analysts are at their greatest. Here, the business analysis work is concerned with improving the business and working with senior management to support the delivery of value to customers.  

### The Capability Maturity Model Integration:  
The CMMI was developed by the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) at Carnegie Mellon University and is an approach used for process improvement in organisations. If we
consider the BAMM in the light of the CMMI, we can see that the five levels of the CMMI apply at each level of the BAMM.
