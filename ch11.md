## Documenting and Managing Requirements  

#### Importance of Documentation:  

- Enables communication within the project team  
- Provides a basis for ensuring all the related requirements are consistent  
- Provides BMs and staff with a firm basis for validating that the documantation accurately records what they need the solution to provide  
- Any further work to develop and test the business solutions will use the documentation as input  
- Defines what the solution is to do and the acceptance criteria required  

#### Requirements Document:  
**Structure**:  
- Provides the basis for the solutions to be delivered so must be well-organised, well-formed and clear.  
- Must provide all the information that the reviewers require in an easily understandable and digestible form.  

**Content**:  
- Introduction and background:  
Describe the business situation and drivers for the project.  
Clarifies the objectives and scope of the project.  
Ensures the stakeholder are aware of the business context for the requirements.  

- Business Process Models:  
Any new or enhanced software solutions must support the business process changes.  
The 'to-be' process models should set out the vision for the new processes (may be accompanied by more detailed task models)  
The 'as-is' process to be revised can be included here for clarity.  

- Function Models:  
Diagrams showing functionality of the proposed software.  
Context diagrams and use case diagrams.  
Provide and overview of the solution and a means of structuring the requirements catalogue.  

- Data Model:  
Relevant where the requirements require a detailed level of data definition.  
Useful to understand the natures of the data and the business rules that apply to the relationships between data groups.  

- Requirements Catalogue:  
Information about each individual requirement should be documented here.  
Key compnaent for the audit trail of the requirements as it is a central repo of information relating to the identification, cross-referencing and source of requirements.  

- Glossary of Terms:  
Provide a clear definition of the term used so that it can be understood by all.

#### Requirements Catalogue:  
When requirements are initially elicited they are not organised, these categories provide a useful overview structure for a requirements catalogue.  

| Business | Solution |
| - | - |
| General | Functional |
| Technical | Non-Functional |

**Categories of Requirements**:  

Within these 4 areas there are several more specific categories.

**General**  
- Business Constraints -> budget, timescale, resources etc.  
- Business Policies -> standards, business policy (business rules). Ensure consistency throughout the org.  
- Legal -> legal and regulatory constraints (GDPR etc)  
- Branding -> image and style to be promoted for the org (logos, fonts, colours).  
- Cultural -> vision of the org, approach and management style.  
- Language -> international boundaries, communication with customers and other organisations.  

**Technical**  
- Hardware -> make and model of hardware. IT and equipment.  
- Software -> OS, applications, networking, communications. Online software and cloud computing.  
- Interoperability -> communicating between systems. Interfaces within org or between orgs.  
- Internet -> technical policies relating to an orgs use of the internet and web-enabled services.  

**Functional**  
Functional requirements can be subject to constant change  
- Data entry -> gathering and recording data that is required in the solution.  
- Data maintenance -> handles changes to the data used within the solution.  
- Procedure -> Key source of error is where detailed business rules and not understood well. Must be defined clearly so that they can be adopted accurately.  
- Retrieval -> concerned with requests about the data.  

**Non-Functional**  
- Speed of performance -> speed with which a transaction should be processed.  
- Level of security -> identify the secutiry levels required for the org's data.  
- Access permissions and constraints ->  security requirements as they define stakeholder groups and their access to the data.  
- Backup and recovery -> secure storage and access of information, protecting against the loss of data and information.  
- Archiving and retention -> internal policies and external regulations ergarding retention of data.  
- Maintainability -> maintaining the solution (servicing, problem investigation and correction)  
- Business continutiy -> ability of org to function in the face of threats (disaster recovery)  
- Availability -> timeframe during which a solution must be available to stakeholders (web-enabled = 24/7)  
- Usability -> ease with which a stakeholder can learn, apply and use new processes and systems.  
- Accessibility -> enabling access for all (cognitive, motor, hearing, visual disabilities)  
- Capacity -> volumes of data or images to be stored, volumes of transactions to be processed and number of stakeholders to be supported.  


#### Hierarchy of Requirements:  
All requirements are related to each other.  
All requirements are driven by the organisation’s values, strategy and objectives.  

#### Documenting a requirement:  
Template:  
```
Requirement identifier
The unique identifier allocated to the requirement. This is often a code that is linked to the type
of requirement. For example, the technical requirements may be allocated the identifier T-n such
as T-001, T-002, etc. The identifier may also include a version number, including a draft version
number for when the requirement is still to be reviewed and agreed. An identifier may be:
G-006v0-1 to indicate a general requirement in its first draft version;
F-028v2-0 to indicate a functional requirement in its second reviewed and agreed version.
Alternatively, the version history for the requirement may include the version number (see
below).

Requirement name
The name allocated to a requirement. This is a short descriptive phrase that indicates what the
requirement concerns.

Requirement description
The description should provide a clear definition of the requirement. Initially, the description
may be at an outline level and elaborated in more detailed versions of the requirement
documentation. When describing requirements it is good practice to adopt the following
structure:
actor (or user role)
verb phrase
object (noun or noun phrase).
An example functional requirement is: ‘the receptionist shall be able to view the customer name,
address and telephone number‛.
An example general requirement is: ‘the solution shall comply with the provisions of the Data
Protection Act‛.

Source
The originating person or information source for the requirement. This may be a stakeholder or
could be a document containing information relevant to the project. For example, a stakeholder
may have identified the requirement during an interview or other discussion, or there may be an
earlier document – such as a project brief or feasibility study – that includes some of the business
requirements.

Owner
The business stakeholder who can make decisions regarding the requirement. Typically, this will
be the business manager responsible for the business function or department, who has the
authority to approve the definition of the requirement.

Author
The analyst who has elicited and documented the requirement.
Type of requirement
The categorisation of the requirement. It may be sufficient to indicate whether the requirement is
general, technical, functional or non-functional – although it may not be necessary to state this if
the identifier includes a reference to the type. The type of requirement may be defined at subcategory
level, for example, a requirement may be general, legal.

Priority
The level of priority of the requirement. The approach used here varies between organisations
but can also vary between different projects within an organisation. Sometimes a straightforward
approach of high, medium or low priority is used with the organisation deciding the implications
of each level. Similarly, sometimes the categories ‘mandatory’, ‘desirable’ and ‘nice to have’ are
used. The Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM) defined a richer approach to
prioritisation using the mnemonic MoSCoW. This approach is particularly suitable where several
increments of a business change solution are to be implemented or iterative development is to be
used to develop a software solution. The MoSCoW mnemonic stands for:
M – Must have. Mandatory in the first increment. Absolutely essential.
S – Should have. Mandatory but may be deferred (for a short period) to the second increment.
C – Could have. Desirable but may not be implemented due to time and budget.
W – Want to have but won’t have this time. Identified as a requirement to be deferred until a
later stage. There may be several reasons why a requirement is deferred. Some requirements are
recognised as needing further consideration and would cause delays to some of the mandatory
requirements if they were to be implemented in the first increment. Other requirements may
require a later implementation for business reasons. This may be because it concerns an element
of the business strategy that is due to be put into operation at a later point or could be an
anticipated legal change.

Business area
The name of the business area to which the requirement belongs. This may be the name of the
business function or department. Alternatively, a more detailed approach may be useful and the
name of the business process or use case may be used.

Stakeholders
The job roles or names of any stakeholders with a particular interest in the successful resolution
of this requirement, and the details of their interest. Identifying stakeholders and their interests
for each requirement provides a useful prompt to the business analyst to ensure that all relevant
stakeholders’ interests have been considered.

Associated non-functional requirements
Some functional requirements are associated with specific non-functional requirement. For
example, there may be a business customer service policy that guarantees a speed of response to
information requests. As a result, the functional requirement about accessing customer account
information may have a performance response time non-functional requirement associated with
it. An alternative approach is to document related requirements (described below).

Acceptance criteria
The criteria that will enable the business staff to formally agree that the requirement has been
delivered. For each requirement, we should consider how we can check or measure if a
requirement has been met.

Related requirements
The identifiers of any requirements that are related to this requirement. They may be related for
several reasons: there is a higher-level business requirement that provides further business
information or justification for a functional or non-functional requirement; there are nonfunctional
requirements concerning areas such as usability or security that affect functional
requirements or vice versa; there are other requirements that concern a similar general, technical,
functional or non-functional area. The identifier for each of the related requirements should be
listed here.

Related documents
The identifiers for any documents that provide further information about this requirement. These
documents may be project documentation such as the project initiation document or may be
business justification documents such as the business case. Another form of documentation that
may be linked to the requirements is the modelling documents that have been created for the
business change project. Some of these models may be contained within the requirements
document however, it is still useful to show where there are requirements that are related to
them.

Comments
Additional comments that the analyst feels are useful to document for a particular requirement.

Rationale
The business justification for the requirement. The rationale for a requirement may be crossreferenced
to specific benefits in the business case.

Resolution
The outcome of a requirement. There are several possibilities as a requirement may be
implemented, deferred for consideration in a later increment, merged with another requirement
or dropped. The resolution will be used to record the decision and the timing of this decision.

Version history
The history of the requirement through the different versions that have been created. This
information should include the version number (although as discussed earlier this may be
combined with the identifier) and the date. Each version should also record the reason for the
change to the requirement and the reference to the change control documentation.
```

#### Managing requirements:  
A failure to understand, document and manage requirements often lies at the heart of problems with business and IT system changes projects.  

The traceability of the requirements is a critical quality characteristic. There are two forms of traceability: horizontal and vertical.  

Horizontal traces the requirement from inception to delivery.  
Backwards from:  
trace the source of a requirement from any later point in the business change or SDLC. ('What was the source requirement for this feature of the solution and who raised it?')  
being able to trace the origin of a requirement is especially helpful if there are conflicting views.  

Forwards to:  
track where any requirement has been further developed and ultimately implemented. ('What happened to this requirement?')  
should show that each requirements has been resolved satsifactorily.  

Vertical traces a requirement up or down the hierarchy (answers questions about alignment with business values, strategy and objectives)  


##### Requirements management components:  
**Requirements identification**:  
Each requirement needs to be identified uniquely in order that any reference to that requirement corresponds to only one requirement.  

**Cross-referencing**:  
During requirements management, the cross-references provide the basis for the impact analysis of proposed changes.  
They allow the analyst to identify which requirements are related to the requirement that is the subject of the change, and consider whether the change will affect the other requirements.  

**Origin and ownership**:  
When considering changes to the requirement, the source can help to clarify the impact of the change and as a result help with the decision about the change.  
The owner (a key stakeholder) typically has responsibility for the business area affected by the requirement and will need to make decisions about the requirement. It is important therefore that this person is involved as the change project unfolds.  

**Configuration management**:  
Configuration management is concerned with controlling any changes made to project deliverables, such as documents, in order to ensure that the changes are made in a disciplined
manner and traceability sustained.  
```
Without effective configuration management the requirements
document can become inaccurate as the following problems can occur:
- inability or difficulty in identifying the latest version of a requirement;
- the reintroduction of out-of-date requirements;
- using the wrong set of requirements for further development or testing work.
As a result, it is important that appropriate mechanisms are developed that will manage the
implementation of any changes to the requirements. There are two key areas to consider:
- configuration identification;
- configuration control.
```  

**Configuration identification**:  
The deliverables to be brought under configuration control (CIs - configuration items)  

**Configuration control**:  
Process for controlling the CIs and ensuring they are not changed without formal approval and version numbering (version control process)  

**Agile**:  
Prototypes are likely to change regularly.  
Each baselined prototype is placed under configuration control to ensure the most up-to-date version is used.  
CI will consist of actual prototype, tests run on it and the record of users' comments.  

**Change control**:  
External factors (legal, competetive forces)  
Internal factors (strategies, polocies, people)  

1. Document the proposed change (change request - who raised it, description, justification)  
2. Consult the stakeholders (assess impact - effort and cost)  
3. Decide (CI released by configuration librarian so change can be applied and new version created)  

**Software support**:  
Automation tools provide support for documentation
