# Delivering the Requirements:  

## 13.1 Delivering the Solution:  

Delivering the requirements could include some or all of:  

- Business Process Changes:  
Altered to be faster, simpler, more accurate or more effective.  

- People Changes:  
Jobs redefined and new task and skills added to roles. Training, coaching and mentoring, recruitment and appraisal.  

- Changes to organisational structure:  
Over time, posts disappear and new ones are created, departments merge and split.  

- Changes to IT Systems:  
Software that supports business processes may need to be enhanced or replaced in order to provide the features and information used by the org.  

### Factors to consider:  

## 13.2 Context:  

-> the nature of the org and project that will provide the basis for deciding how the solution will be delivered.  
**Key Factors**:  
- Culture and underlying philosphy of the org (What type of org is it? What is the nature of the business domain within which it operates? What are teh values and beliefs of the senior managers?)
- Business context for the proposed changes (What is the org hoping to achieve in terms of business benefit as a result of this project?)  
- Constraints that impinge upon the project (What is the timescale for delivering the solution? What is the budget? What resources are to be made available? What standards does the org use?)  
- Prioritised needs of the business (Improved public image? Cost savings?)  
- Drivers for the project (Need to comply with new legislation? Offering additional or enhanced services to customers?)  

**Lifecyle**  
-> the process adopted for developing and implementing the solution.  
**Approach**  
-> the methods and standards that are used during the lifecycle. 
- Concept of a SDLC:  

## 13.3 Lifecycles:  

### Waterfall

```
BAs would typically be involved in the feasibility study and analysis stages of the project. They
would also probably assist in the user acceptance that forms part of the testing stage and help the
business users during implementation. During design and development, BAs would be available
to answer queries about the business and solution requirements raised by the development team.
```

### V Model  

Connect the developmental stages with the testing stages, Test criteria is made explicit at each stage.  

```
The business analyst is involved at the outset in assessing the business needs and
defining the requirements. The later activities of ensuring user acceptance and reviewing the
benefits also form part of the business analyst role.
The design, development and testing stages are primarily the remit of
technical architects, developers and software testers. However, the business analyst should still
be involved during these stages for the following reasons:
to ensure that the business needs continue to be met;
to develop the process and job role definitions that will be implemented alongside the
IT solution;
to assess the impact of proposed changes.
```

### Incremental Delivery:  
Some requirements are more urgent or important than others.  

Incremental delivery lifecyles:

Analysis and design are completed initially followed by incremental delivery phases, each consiting of devlopment, testing and implementation.  
Most pressing requirements are in the first phase.  
Higher cost than delivering in one release. Due to the need to ensure each increment does not interfere with the previous (regression testing).  

### Iterative Systems Development:  
Waterfall, V and incremental models all gather a complete set of requirements at the start of the project.  

Iterative (Spiral Model, Rapid Application Development, Agile - DSDM, Scrum)  

```
The iterative development approach is founded upon some fundamental generic principles:

Evolutionary – Detailed requirements are evolved through a series of iterative
prototyping development stages.

Empowerment and collaboration – It is a fundamental requirement that the team,
including business staff and IT developers, are empowered to make decisions during
the software development and work as a collaborative team.

Fitness for purpose – The deliverables are required to be fit for purpose rather than
aligned slavishly with a set of defined requirements.

Testing all the time – Testing is an integral part of the iterative development approach
so the software should be tested continuously. Automated testing tools are very useful
in doing this.

Re-factoring – Iterative development adopts an exploratory approach so any work
may be reversed if it does not add value. This is not perceived as being a mistake or
waste of time but instead as an integral part of the iterative process.

Incremental delivery – The system is likely to be deployed in increments, with each
subsequent increment providing additional functionality or improved performance.

Prioritisation – An approach such as MoSCoW (see Chapter 11) is used to identify the
different levels of priority amongst the features to be delivered.

Timeboxing – The concept of a ‘timebox’ whereby time limit is set, at the outset, for
the development of part of the system. Prioritisation is used to provide some
contingency in the timebox, for example by including features of a lower priority that
may be deferred or dropped if time does not allow.

BA uncovers the needs to be met.

Identify options and feasibility:
A feasibility study is conducted to determine the options that the business might pursue in order
to address the business need. This will set out the options available, in particular the costs,
benefits, impacts and risks of each alternative option, and possibly a preferred option.

Define and agree business requirements:
Once a preferred option has been selected, the high-level business requirements need to be
defined, from which more detailed solution requirements can be derived. This stage identifies the
scope for the systems development project by defining a set of high-level features to be delivered
by the solution. These high-level requirements are also prioritised during this stage.

Elaborate solution requirements:
The high-level business requirements are explored and elaborated into more detailed
requirements for the solution, using techniques such as storyboards, wire frames and prototyping.
An iterative approach is adopted in order to develop a final, operational prototype. This confirms
the functional requirements to be built and deployed in the current release.
As Agile development projects typically deliver functionality incrementally, this stage and the
following two stages (engineer solution and deploy solution) will be repeated for each
incremental solution delivery.

Engineer solution:
Once the functionality for the current delivery has been agreed, a production-ready solution is
built that can be deployed into the live environment. This stage will addresses the non-functional
requirements and technical infrastructure required to turn the operational prototype into a fully
fledged, working solution.

Deploy solution:
The tasks necessary to deploy the working solution into the live operational environment are
conducted, including data take-on, data conversion, preparation of documentation, end-user
training, installation of the live environment and transition to the service delivery team.

Evaluate solution:
Once the solution is ‘live’, typically some period of time after it has been deployed, an
evaluation of the solution is undertaken to determine whether it has met the business objectives
and is working satisfactorily. This review may lead to perfective maintenance to improve aspects
such as performance and usability. Once the final version is deployed, a benefits review will be
conducted to examine whether or not the benefits have been realised and, if not, identify any
further actions required to enable their realisation.
```

**Advantages and disadvantages:**  
Waterfall, V and incremental afford a high level of control.  
However, there may not be time to define all requirements at the beginning and it is unlikely users will know exactly what they want.  
Change is so rapid that requirements can become out-of-date very quickly - even before a project has finished.  
Agile is more flexible to accommodate changes during teh project.  

### Development and Delivery Approach:  
Devlopment:  
- are we able to work collaboratively with the business users during the development of the solution or is this not possible?  
- are the requirements unclear or well understood?  
Delivery:  
- do we require one delivery of the entire solution or a phased delivery using incremental releases?  

**Unified Process from Object Management Group**:  
generic software development process  
both an iterative and incremental approach  
based on the principle of using UML techniques  

**Agile - DSDM and Scrum**:  
able to respond quickly to changes  
flexible  


#### Prioritisation:  
MoSCoW:  
Must haves - first increment  
Should haves - become must haves in second increment  
Could haves - can be incorporated if time allows  
Wants - considered for later increments  

#### Software Package Approach:  
Often companies want to buy off-the-shelf (COTS) solutions rather than developing it in house or outsourcing devs.  
Almost certainly cheaper than having to fund creating the software from scratch  
Faster implementation  
Maintenance available from creators  
COTS vendors must keep up to date with legislation  

Not always a perfect fit compared to made to measure software  
Competetive advantage not really available this way  

**Roles**  
-> the key roles to be filled during the project.  
Depends on 3 factors:  
Context of org and project  
Nature of lifecycle selected  
Approach adopted  

Typically:  
Project Manageer  
Business Analyst  
Developer  
Tester  

Project Sponser  
Data Analyst  
Business User  
Technical Architect  

**Deliverables** 
-> the products to be delivered by the project team.  
Should always be suitable for purpose.  

**Techniques**  
-> the management and developments techniques used to plan, analyse and document the project work.  
Waterfall - formal documentation that is reviewed and signed off. Formal and rigorous techniques for documenting and modelling requirements.  
Agile - protyping, wireframes, scenarios, user stories.  
Templates provided by the business.  
Support tools.
