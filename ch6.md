## Stakeholder Analysis and Management  

A good working definition of a stakeholder is ‘anyone who has an interest in, or may be affected by, the issue under consideration’. This means, more or less, anyone affected by the project or who may be in a position to influence it.  

Of course, each project will have its own distinctive set of stakeholders, determined by the nature of the project and the environment in which it is taking place.  

Effective stakeholder management is absolutely crucial to the success of any business analysis project. Knowing who the stakeholders are, and understanding what it is they expect from the project and delivered solution, is vital if they are to remain involved and supportive of the undertaking. One of the major reasons why business analysis projects do not succeed – or do not succeed fully – is poor stakeholder management. The project team does not recognise the importance, or even the existence, of a key stakeholder and they find that their plans are constantly frustrated. On the other hand, if the right stakeholders are identified and managed properly, most obstacles can be cleared from the path. In fact, much of the groundwork for stakeholder management takes place before the business analysis project proper begins – during project inception and initiation – and that work must be revisited constantly during the project itself.  

Identify Stakeholders --> Analyse Stakeholders --> Devise Stakeholder Management Strategies --> Review/Revise Stakeholder Management Strategies  
The first 3 steps are completed during project initiation and inception and the last step during project execution  

The main responsibility for stakeholder management may rest with the project manager or with a senior business analyst. However, all team members have important roles to play, in identifying stakeholders, in helping to understand their needs and by helping to manage their expectations of the project.  

It is important for each project that the identification of stakeholders is as complete as possible, as it will otherwise be impossible to develop and implement effective management strategies for them. It may be useful to conduct some sort of workshop with people knowledgeable about the organisation and the proposed project to make sure that the coverage of stakeholders is comprehensive.  

### Stakeholder Categories and Identification:  

<img src="https://analyst-zone.com/storage/app/media/Techniques/Stakeholders_StakeholderIdentification_StakeholderWheel_Technique_Texavi_AnalystZone.png"><img>  

#### Customers:  
These are the people or organisations for whom our organisation provides products or services. They are stakeholders because anything we do in the way of change has a potential effect on them. We must consider how to manage that change most effectively so as not to lose customers that we wish to retain. It may be useful to subdivide this general category to reveal more detail about the stakeholders, for example into:  
- large or small;  
- regular or occasional;  
- wholesale or retail;  
- corporate or private;  
- commercial, non-profit or public-sector;  
- civilian or military;  
- domestic or export.  

#### Partners:  
These are the organisations that work with our organisation, for example, to provide specialist services on our behalf. Examples of partner organisations may be a reseller of our products or services or an outsourcing company that provides catering services.  

#### Suppliers:  
These provide us with the goods and services that we use. Again, we may wish to subdivide them:  
- major or minor;  
- regular or occasional;  
- domestic or overseas.  
Suppliers are stakeholders because they are interested in the way we do business with them, what we wish to buy, how we want to pay and so on. Many change initiatives have the effect of altering the relationships of organisations with their suppliers and, as with the customers, such changes need to be managed carefully to make sure that they achieve positive and mutually beneficial results.  

#### Competitors:  
Competitors vie with us for the business of our customers and they therefore have a keen interest in changes made by our organisation. We have to consider what their reactions might be and whether they might try, for instance, to block our initiative or to produce some sort of counterproposal.  

#### Regulators:  
Many organisations are now subject to regulation or inspection – either by statutory bodies like Ofcom (Office for Communications) and Ofsted (Office for Standards in Education), or by professional bodies like the General Medical Council. These regulators will be concerned that changes proposed by an organisation are within the letter and spirit of the rules they enforce.  

#### Owners:  
For a commercial business, the owners are just that – the people who own it directly. The business may be, in legal terms, a sole trader or partnership. Or, it could be a limited company, in which case the owners are the shareholders. For public limited companies, the majority of shares are held by institutions like investment companies and pension funds and so the managers of these share portfolios become proxy owners.  

#### Employees:  
The people who work in an organisation clearly have an interest in the way it is run and in changes that it makes. In a small firm, the employees may be regarded as individual stakeholders in their own right but, in larger concerns, they are probably best considered as groups. Sometimes, employees belong to trades unions, whose officials therefore become stakeholders too.  

#### Managers:  
Finally, we have the professional managers of the organisation, those to whom its direction is entrusted. In a large organisation, there may be many layers of management and each may form a distinctive stakeholder grouping, for example:  
- board-level senior managers;  
- middle managers;  
- junior managers;  
- front-line supervisors.  

As with many aspects of stakeholder management, it is an error to assume that a group like ‘managers’ is homogeneous in its views and concerns; junior managers may well have a very different perspective, and a different set of values and priorities, from those on the board who take the major strategic decisions.  

#### Other Stakeholders:  
- Insurers (interested in decisions that could affect risk)  
- Police (interested in decisions that might affect law and order)  
- staff associations  

### Analysing Stakeholders:  
Having identified the stakeholders, the next step is to make an assessment of the weight that should be attached to their issues. No stakeholder should be ignored completely but the approach to each will be different depending on (a) their level of interest in the project and (b) the amount of power or influence they wield to further or obstruct it.  

One technique for analysing stakeholders is the power/interest grid illustrated below:

### Stakeholder Management Strategies:  
In using the power/interest grid, it is important to plot stakeholders where they actually are, not where they should be or perhaps where we would like them to be. We can then explore strategies for managing them in their positions or, perhaps, for moving them to other positions that might be more advantageous for the success of our project. There is, of course, an infinite number of positions that could be taken on the power/interest grid but it is probably sufficient here to consider the nine basic situations.  

#### No or Low Interest and No or Low Power/Influence:  
These are stakeholders who have neither a direct interest in the project nor any real power to affect it. For practical purposes, they can be ignored as regards day-to-day issues on a project and there needs to be no special effort made to ‘sell’ them its benefits. However, as stakeholders do change positions on the map (discussed below), it is probably wise to inform them occasionally about what is going on – perhaps through vehicles like organisation newsletters.  

#### Some or High Interest but No or Low Power/Influence:  
These groups can be very difficult to manage effectively as, although they may be directly affected by a change project, they feel powerless to shape its direction in any way. This can result in frustration and a passive resistance to change that, though overcome by positional power, can lead to delay and less-than-optimal results.  

The basic management strategy here is to keep such stakeholders informed of what is going on and, in particular, of the reasons for the proposed change. But this is a rather passive approach and, in most circumstances, more effort has to be devoted to ‘selling’ the project. This can best be done by being as honest as possible about the need for change; by highlighting the positive aspects of the change or the negative consequences of not making it; and by frequent and focused communication of progress.  

#### No or Low to High Interest but Some Power/Influence:  
This is a rather varied group. It includes some stakeholders like middle or senior managers who do have some power or influence but who, because their interests are not directly affected, are not very concerned about the direction a project is taking. Regulators may also fall into this category and they will only start to get involved if some breach of the rules is suspected when they could, in effect, squash an initiative. The group can also include people with more interest in the project but, again, only some power or influence over it.  

The best approach with this group is to keep them supportive of the project, possibly by frequent, positive communication with them but perhaps also by involving them more with the project. As the old saying has it, it is better to have them inside the glasshouse throwing stones out than outside throwing them in.  

#### No or Low Interest but High Power/Influence:  
These are probably very senior managers who, for one reason or another, have no direct interest in the project. This may be because it is too small or unimportant for them to bother with or it may be that it is in an area that doesn’t interest them; the Group Marketing Director, for instance, probably will not be concerned about a project to streamline the stationery purchasing procedures. For many purposes, it might be thought that they can be ignored but this is actually a rather risky approach. Our Marketing Director may, for instance, suddenly get very interested in the stationery system if she keeps getting pens that don’t work or can’t get hold of any sticky notes for a conference! So, if a situation arises that might cause them to take a greater interest in the project, we might want to address their needs directly, via one-to-one meetings perhaps, in order to ensure that they do not start to raise concerns or even decide to exert their influence. In some situations it is possible that we may wish to encourage the increased interest of influential stakeholders, for example, if we felt that their support would help achieve the project objectives. Where this is the case, we may need to highlight any aspects of the project that will have a direct impact upon the stakeholder’s business area; some form of discussion will be required which, with very influential stakeholders, would typically involve a meeting.  

#### Some Interest and High Power/Influence:  
These people have some interest in the project – probably an indirect one as it is happening within or affecting their empire – and they have real power. The usual stakeholder management strategy here is to keep them satisfied and, perhaps, to prevent them from taking a more direct (and hence, possibly, more obstructive) interest in the project. In other circumstances, the strategy may be precisely the opposite – to get the stakeholder more actively involved in a project. For example, if the finance director of an organisation can be persuaded to get positively involved in a project, they will often be a powerful force for success, since they can make resources available that would otherwise be hard to come by.  

#### High Interest and High Power/Influence:  
These are the key players, the people who are both interested in the project and have the power to make it work or not. Often, the key players are the managers of the functions involved in a project. Initially, it is important to determine if individual key stakeholders are positive or negative in their approach to a project. If positive, then their enthusiasm must be sustained, especially during times of difficulty. It is also important to appreciate the concerns and opinions of key stakeholders and you will need to take these into account when making any recommendations. For example, if one of the key stakeholders has a particular solution in mind it is important to know about this as early as possible in order to ensure that, at the very least, the solution is evaluated as one of the options. It is also vital that the key stakeholders understand the progress of the project and why certain decisions have been made. These are the people to whom any final recommendations will be presented and who will have the final say on any decisions. They need to be kept informed at all stages of the project so that none of the recommendations come as a shock to them.  

Those key players who are negatively inclined towards a project can be managed in various ways, depending on the circumstances:

- By far the best approach is to find some personal benefits for them in the proposed course of action. The stakeholder perspective analysis techniques described below can be very useful here.  
- Alternatively, a more powerful counterforce must be found to outweigh their negative influence. This may mean engaging the interest of someone in one of the high power areas of the grid.  

### Individuals and Groups:  
An individual customer may not be of much concern to an organisation such as a big supermarket chain. But if they post a negative review using social media, write to newspapers, organise petitions or complain to consumer groups, they can increase their level of power considerably. A lot of ‘people power’ can damage even large concerns considerably and force them into major reversals of course. The classic example of this is the mighty Coca-Cola being forced to reintroduce its traditional Coke in the face of a massive worldwide customer revolt against a new formula. Similarly, individual employees can be marginalised by an organisation but, if they are members of a trade union, their power is greater. A single government employee who objects to a policy may be relatively powerless but if they ‘blow the whistle’ to national newspapers, they can cause considerable difficulty.  

These examples illustrate the dangers of ignoring the weakness of an individual or mistaking individual weakness for collective weakness. Stakeholders must be considered not just as individuals but as potential groups as well. Their ability to gain strength, particularly with the availability of social media mechanisms, should never be underestimated.  

### Managing Stakeholders:  
Stakeholders’ positions on the framework do not remain static during the life of a project. At the most obvious level, a manager may get promoted so that, from being in the high interest/low power situation, is now both interested and powerful. Alternatively, the manager may lose interest in a project if promoted into a job with a wider remit. The circumstances of an organisation may change so that senior managers begin to focus more on IT projects. A scandal within a competitor organisation may cause a regulator to take a closer interest in all companies in a sector. This means that stakeholder analysis must be a continuing activity throughout the project – and even afterwards to find out what the stakeholders thought of the final outcome. The project team and project manager should be constantly on the lookout for changes in stakeholders’ positions and should be re-evaluating their management strategies accordingly. Once stakeholders’ initial positions have been plotted, a plan should be drawn up for managing each of them and how to approach it.  
A one-page assessment can be made for each stakeholder but a more useful approach would be to see all stakeholders at a glance by setting up a spreadsheet using the following headings:  
- Name (and job title)  
- Current Power/Influence  
- Current Interest  
- Issues and Interests (This is a brief summary of what interests each stakeholder and what we believe their main issues with the project are likely to be.)  
- Current Attitude (See table below)  
| Position | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Champion | will actively work for the success of the project. |
| Supporter | in favour of the project but probably will not be very active in promoting it. |
| Neutral | has expressed no opinion either in favour or against the project. |
| Critic | not in favour of the project but probably not actively opposed to it. |
| Opponent | will work actively to disrupt, impede or derail the project. |
| Blocker | someone who will just obstruct progress, possibly for reasons outside of the project itself. |  

- Desired Support (What we would ideally like from this stakeholder, perhaps using a simple scale of high, medium or low.)  
- Desired Role (We may wish to get this stakeholder actively involved in the project, perhaps as the project sponsor or as part of a steering committee.)  
- Desired Actions (What we would like the stakeholder to do, if at all possible, to advance the project.)  
- Messages to Convey (This is where we define the emphasis that should be put on any communications to this stakeholder. For example, we might need to identify and highlight any issues that are of particular interest to this stakeholder. The messages are likely to be tailored to each stakeholder and so the more we know about them and their concerns, the more effective our communications will be.)  
- Actions and Communications (This is the most important part of the plan, where we define exactly what actions we will take with regard to this stakeholder. It may be just to keep them informed, in a positive way, about the project and progress to date. Alternatively, it may be a more active approach, for example meeting them to engage their interest in the project. Where a strategy has been devised to change a stakeholder’s position – perhaps to encourage someone to take a closer interest – then its success must also be evaluated and other approaches developed if the desired results are not being achieved. As mentioned earlier, the high interest/high power stakeholders are the key players and require positive management, such as frequent meetings and discussions about the direction the project is taking. This will help make sure that they are kept informed about a project and are happy with the approach that we are taking. Perhaps just as important, we will understand when their opinions or issues have changed and will reflect this in the project direction and work as appropriate.)
