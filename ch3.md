## Strategy Analysis  

There are four main aspects of strategy analysis to understand:  
- what it is and why it is important
- how strategy is developed  
- how strategy is implemented  
- how this applies to BAs  

It is important for BAs to be comfortable with the tools that managers use and the process of strategy development is a key tool.  

#### Why is strategy important?  
##### There are some big changes being faced by organisations such as:  
- How we are employed; greater use of contract and part-time. Growth of knowledge-based industries means individual employees are valuable assets.  
Attitudes to work have change - careers aren't for life now. We all now want great job satisfaction, higher rewards, more personal recognition and flexible working environments.  
- Society; greater freedom of expression. Less respect for authority unless it has been earned.  

Organisations must become more flexible to cope with these changes.  

- Global v Local; having a global reach does not mean the biggest. Scarcity of product, brand recognition and distribution channels make the difference.  
- Centralised v Decentralised organisation structures; fincance may be central but discounts and prices are set locally.  
- Hard and Soft management; Developing strategy is seen as a hard skill but the creativity and change skills are seen as soft.  

How can an organisation form a strategy if the future is so unpredictable?  

##### What is Strategy (in a business context)?  
- The goal or mission of the business. In strategy terms this is often referred to as the direction.  
- The time frame. Strategy is about the long term. The problem here is that it differs widely across industries, with petrochemicals and pharmaceuticals at the really long end and domestic financial services products at the short end.  
- The organisation of resources such as finance, skills, assets and technical competence so that the organisation can compete.  
- The environment within which the organisation will operate and its markets.  

`Strategy is the direction and scope of an organisation over the long term, which achieves advantage in 
a changing environment through its configuration of resources and competences with the aim of 
fulfilling stakeholder expectations.`

##### Issues to be considered during strategy analysis:  
- the long-term direction of the organisation  
- the scope of an organistation's activities  
- advantage for the organisation over competition  
- strategic fit with the business environment  
- the organisation's resources and competencies  
- the values and experiences of powerful actors  

Strategies exist in all levels of an organisation from corporates strategies at the top level to the operational strategies for products and services.  
- Corporate strategy is concerned with the overall scope and purpose of the business. These are influenced by investors, governments and global competition.  
- Business Unit Strategy (SBU) is concerned with choice of products, pricing, customer satisfaction and competetive advantage.  
- Operational Strategy is concerned with the delivery of the above strategies through effective organisation and development of resources, processes and people.  

#### Strategy Development  
- How is strategy developed?  
- What kinds of strategy should be developed?  
- Where does strategy development come from?  

Strategy can be assosiated with an individual -> a CEO who decides the direction of a business or a founder.  
Strategy can be developed from views of internal managers -> meetings and discussions mean that this strategy with be developed in an incremental, negotiated way.  
Encourage the generation of new ideas from within the organisation so that strategy emerges from the people who do the work.  
Adopt a carefully planned design process - this is helpful when looking at a truly long term strategy.
