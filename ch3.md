## Strategy Analysis  

There are four main aspects of strategy analysis to understand:  
- what it is and why it is important
- how strategy is developed  
- how strategy is implemented  
- how this applies to BAs  

It is important for BAs to be comfortable with the tools that managers use and the process of strategy development is a key tool.  

#### Why is strategy important?  
##### There are some big changes being faced by organisations such as:  
- How we are employed; greater use of contract and part-time. Growth of knowledge-based industries means individual employees are valuable assets.  
Attitudes to work have change - careers aren't for life now. We all now want great job satisfaction, higher rewards, more personal recognition and flexible working environments.  
- Society; greater freedom of expression. Less respect for authority unless it has been earned.  

Organisations must become more flexible to cope with these changes.  

- Global v Local; having a global reach does not mean the biggest. Scarcity of product, brand recognition and distribution channels make the difference.  
- Centralised v Decentralised organisation structures; fincance may be central but discounts and prices are set locally.  
- Hard and Soft management; Developing strategy is seen as a hard skill but the creativity and change skills are seen as soft.  

How can an organisation form a strategy if the future is so unpredictable?  

##### What is Strategy (in a business context)?  
- The goal or mission of the business. In strategy terms this is often referred to as the direction.  
- The time frame. Strategy is about the long term. The problem here is that it differs widely across industries, with petrochemicals and pharmaceuticals at the really long end and domestic financial services products at the short end.  
- The organisation of resources such as finance, skills, assets and technical competence so that the organisation can compete.  
- The environment within which the organisation will operate and its markets.  

`Strategy is the direction and scope of an organisation over the long term, which achieves advantage in 
a changing environment through its configuration of resources and competences with the aim of 
fulfilling stakeholder expectations.`

##### Issues to be considered during strategy analysis:  
- the long-term direction of the organisation  
- the scope of an organistation's activities  
- advantage for the organisation over competition  
- strategic fit with the business environment  
- the organisation's resources and competencies  
- the values and experiences of powerful actors  

Strategies exist in all levels of an organisation from corporates strategies at the top level to the operational strategies for products and services.  
- Corporate strategy is concerned with the overall scope and purpose of the business. These are influenced by investors, governments and global competition.  
- Business Unit Strategy (SBU) is concerned with choice of products, pricing, customer satisfaction and competetive advantage.  
- Operational Strategy is concerned with the delivery of the above strategies through effective organisation and development of resources, processes and people.  

#### Strategy Development  
- How is strategy developed?  
- What kinds of strategy should be developed?  
- Where does strategy development come from?  

Strategy can be assosiated with an individual -> a CEO who decides the direction of a business or a founder.  
Strategy can be developed from views of internal managers -> meetings and discussions mean that this strategy with be developed in an incremental, negotiated way.  
Encourage the generation of new ideas from within the organisation so that strategy emerges from the people who do the work.  
Adopt a carefully planned design process - this is helpful when looking at a truly long term strategy.  

While strategy is regarded as an organised and logical process it can also be driven by the politics in an organisation;  
different interest groups form around different strategic ideas and compete for resources and support of the stakeholders.  
This power comes from five main sources:  
- Dependency:  
departments are dependent of those that have control over resources (HR power increases if all new staff have to be authorised by them)  
- Financial resources:  
whoever controls the funds for new ideas, products or services has control  
- Position:  
where are the actors in the organisation structure and how does their work affect the organisation's performance?  
- Uniqueness:  
no other part of the organisation can do what the powerful group does  
- Uncertainty:  
power resides with people and groups who can cope with unpredictable effect of the environment and protect other groups

Whatever the approach, external and internal analysis is needed:  
#### External -> What is happeneing out there?  
- Most organisations face a complex and changing external environment of increasing unpredictability.  
-> state of national and local economies  
-> product cost (price competition and moving manufacturing to lower cost economies)  
-> changes in consumer lifestyles and tastes  
-> changes in technology  
-> new marketing approaches (online or catalogue v shops)  

The **PESTLE** (AKA PESTEL or PEST) framework helps examine the external issues and influences

PESTLE should not be treated as a checklist but should aid in identifying those few factors that will really affect the organisation and to develop a real understanding of how they might evolve in the future.  

- Few businesses have no competition, even those in the not-for-profit sector, and most seek to develop and keep a competitive advantage over their rivals.  

Michael Porter's **Five Forces Model** helps to evaluate an industryâ€™s profitability and hence its attractiveness.

In the centre is the competitive battleground where rivals compete and where competitive strategies are developed.  
Organisations need to understand the nature of their competitive environment.  
Additionally, they will be in a stronger position if they understand the interplay of the five forces and can develop defences against the threats they pose.  

- Threat of New Entrants  
-> Economies of Scale  
-> Substantial initial investments  
-> Product differentiation  
Existing products may have such strong identities, supported by branding  
-> Access to distribution channels  
Existing distribution channels may be booked by existing suppliers  
-> Patents  
-> Regulatory approval requirements  

- Bargaining power of Suppliers  
-> Supplying business are often larger than the businesses they supply  
-> Costs of switching are high  
-> Supplier brands can be powerful  
-> Customers are fragmented so do not have a collective influence  

- Bargaining power of Buyers  
-> Multiple small organisations on the supply side  
Such as the many suppliers to supermarkets  
-> Alternative suppliers are easy to source  
-> Costs of the product or service is high  
This causes buyers to seek alternatives  
-> Switching costs are low  

- Threat of Substitute Products  
-> Product substitution from new technologies is more convenient  
-> The need for the product may be replaces by meeting a different need  
-> It is possible to decide to do without it  

There is also potential for high competition when:  
- there are many competing firms;buyers can easily switch from one firm to another  
- the market is growing only slowly or not growing at all  
- the industry has high fixed costs and responding to price pressure is difficult  
- products are not well differentiated or are commoditised so there is little brand loyalty  
- the costs of leaving the industry are high  

PESTLE and Porter are useful frameworks to analyse the external environment. However, even with this information there can be surprises (COVID-19 anyone?)  
Scenarios are useful when thinking about high levels of uncertianty.  
-> They look at the medium- and long-term future and, by evaluating possible different futures, prepare the organisation and its managers to deal with them.  
-> They begin by identifying the potential high impact and high uncertainty factors in the environment.  
-> Once at least four plausible and detailed scenarios are constructed the future each of these scenarios would construct is then considered using the PESTLE framework.  

Internal -> Where does the organisation fit in to what's happening out there?  

Once a strategy is formulated it should be provided in a written statement.  WHY?  
- provides focus for the organisation and enables all parts to understand the reason behind decisions and how all can contribute ot its achievement.  
- provides a framework for a practical allocation of investment and other resources.  
- provides a guide to innovations, where new products, services or systems are needed.  
- enables appropriate performance measures to be put in place that measure key indicators of the success of the strategy.  
- tells the outside world especially outside stakeholders and market analysts about the organisation and develops the expectations.
