## Making a Business and Financial Case  

This is the place where the BAs present their findings and proposed course of action to senior management for their consideration.  

This should be produced and revised as the project proceeds, as more information is uncovered.  
The initial case comes from a feasibility study - broad requirements and ballpark figures - but should be re-examined once the solution has been desinged and more reliable figures are available.  
It should be reviewed again before the solution is deployed, as figures are more reliable and the business circumastances may have changed.

The review points are called decision gates and should pass before moving on.

Identify the **what** (what the proposed solution intends to achieve) and the **how** (how the solution will be implemented - often through IT)
