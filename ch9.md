## Making a Business and Financial Case  

This is the place where the BAs present their findings and proposed course of action to senior management for their consideration.  

This should be produced and revised as the project proceeds, as more information is uncovered.  
The initial case comes from a feasibility study - broad requirements and ballpark figures - but should be re-examined once the solution has been desinged and more reliable figures are available.  
It should be reviewed again before the solution is deployed, as figures are more reliable and the business circumastances may have changed.

The review points are called decision gates and should pass before moving on.  

### Putting together a business case:  

Identify the **what** (what the proposed solution intends to achieve) and the **how** (how the solution will be implemented - often through IT)  
Workshops, brainstorming, problem-solving, BAM and BPM are all usefull techniques here.  
The aim is to get all possible options on the table - even far-fetched ones - to open a discussion.

Options that are too expensive, too time-consuming or counter-culturals can be quickly eliminated at this point.  
A shortlist of three or four options including a 'do-nothing' (status-quo) option should remain. Each of the short-listed options should address the major business issues but offer some distinctive balance of the time they will take to implement, the budget required and the range of features offered.  
- the bottom option just deals with the most pressing issues, as quickly as possible and at minimal cost.  
- the next option adds some additional features to the solution but costs more and takes longer.  
- the last option a comprehensive solution but obviously takes the longest and costs the most.  

#### Assessing project viability:  
There are many issues to think about in assessing feasibility but all fall under the three broad headings

<img src="https://sathyamedha.com/consultancy-services/business-analysis-consultancy-services/img/aspects-of-feasibility-03.png"><img>  

**Business**  
- does the proposal match the business objectives and strategy?  
- will it be delivered in sufficient time to secure the desired benefits?  
- does it fit with the management structure and with its culture?  
- does it align with the enterprise architecture?  
- does it align with other processes that might not be changing (but interact with the proposed changed processes)  
- is it acceptabel to relevant regulators?  

**Technical**  
- does it meet the organisation's demands in terms of system performance?
- availability?  
- reliability?  
- maintainability?  
- security?  
- is the solutions scalable? up and down?  
- is it compatible with other systems?  

**Financial**  
- can the organisation afford it? (do they have the required funds or the ability to borrow?)  
- is the return considered acceptable? (amount and time-scale)  

PESTLE is a useful tool for assessing feasibility:  
- **Political:** Is the proposed solution politically acceptable?  
- **Economic:** Can the organisation afford the solution?  
- **Socio-cultural:** Does the solution fit with the organisation’s culture?  
- **Technological:** Can the solution be achieved, technically?  
- **Legal:** Is it legal, will the regulator allow it?  
- **Environmental:** Does it raise any ‘green’ environmental issues?  

Force-field analysis is another useful tool:  

<img src="https://sathyamedha.com/consultancy-services/business-analysis-consultancy-services/img/force-field-analysis-04.png"><img>   

This considers forces inside and outside the organisation that will support the solution and those that will oppose it - the positives must outweigh the negatives.  

### Structure of a Business Case:  
Some organisations want large documents, some prefer short and to the point (as little as an A4 in some cases)  
Whatever their size, however, the structure and content of most business cases are similar and tend to include these elements:  

**introduction;**  
- set the scene  
- describe methods used  
- acknowledgements  

**management summary;**  
- what the study was about and what was found out about the issues under consideration  
- a survey of the options considered, with their principal advantages and disadvantages  
- a clear statement of the recommendation being made and the decision required  

**description of the current situation;**  
- discuss the current situation and explain where problems and opportunities lie  

**options considered;**  
- brief explanation of why some option have been rejected  
- describe chosen solution and why it is recommended  

**analysis of costs and benefits;**  
- present benefits before costs (just good basic psychology)  
- consider the types of costs and benefits (immediate or long-term/tangible or intangible?)

<img src="https://sathyamedha.com/consultancy-services/business-analysis-consultancy-services/img/categories-of-costs-and-benefits-05.png"><img>  

Costs are usually tangible, benefits are a mix.  
It should be possible to put a numeric value on any cost or benefit (there is seldom the time to conduct the relevant research to provide the data)  
Do not over-state intangible benefits. State what they are and emphasise them but let the decision-makers add their own valuations to them.  
Do not base cost-benefits on assumptions  

##### Tangible costs:  
- Development staff costs  
- User staff costs  
- Equipment  
- Infrastructure  
- Packaged software  
- Relocation  
- Staff training  
- Ongoing costs  

##### Intangible costs:  
- Disruption and loss of productivity  
- Recruitment  

##### Tangible benefits:  
- Staff savings  
- Reduced effort and improved speed of working  
- Faster reponses to customers  
- Reduced accommodation costs  
- Reduced inventory  
- Reduced overtime  

##### Intangible benefits:  
- Increased job satisfaction  
- Improved customer satisfaction  
- Better management information  
- Greater organisational flexibility  
- More problem-solving time  
- Improved presentation and better market image  
- Better communications  

**impact assessment;**  
- organisational structure (reorganising departments or functions or roles)  
- Interdepartmental relations  
- Working practices (new processes and systems lead to changes in working practices)  
- Mangement style  
- Recruitment policy (different skill needed)  
- Appraisal and promotion criteria (change in targets and incentives to encourage different behaviours)  
- Supplier relations  

**risk assessment;**  
- identify potential risks and make available suitable countermeasures  
- risk log:  
Description  
Impact Assessment  
Probability  
Countermeasures  
Ownership  
- document show-stopping risks in the body of the business case and the rest in the appendix if there are a lot!  

**recommendations;**  
- if the business case is for carrying out a project of some sort, then an outline of the main tasks and timescales envisaged is useful to the decision-makers  
- Gantt chart or bar chart is useful for illustrating this  

**appendices, with supporting information.**  


##### Investment Appraisal:  
- payback calculation  

| Item | Year 0 | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 |
| ---- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Hardware purchase | 200,000 | - | - | - | - |
| Hardware maintenance | 30,000 | 30,000 | 30,000 | 30,000 | 30,000 |
| Software purchase | 150,000 | - | - | - | - |
| Software support | 30,000 | 30,000 | 30,000 | 30,000 | 30,000 |
| Staff savings | 150,000 | 150,000 | 150,000 | 150,000 | 150,000 |
| Cash flow for year (savings less costs) | -260,000 | 90,000 | 90,000 | 90,000 | 90,000|
| Cumulative cash flow | -260,000 | -170,000 | -80,000 | +10,000 | +100,000 |

Year 0 - costs outweigh benefits by a lot  
Year 3 - benefits are finally exceeding the costs  

A method that takes account of the time value of money is known as discounted cash flow (DCF) which leads to a ‘net present value’ (NPV) for the project.  
This method calculates the value of the money by studying the likely movement of the markets etc.  

| Year | Net cash flow | Discount factor | Present value |
| ---- | ------------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| 0 | -260,000 | 1.000 | -260,000 |
| 1 | 90,000 | 0.909 | 81,810 |
| 2 | 90,000 | 0.826 | 74,340 |
| 3 | 90,000 | 0.751 | 67,590 |
| 4 | 90,000 | 0.683 | 61,470 |
Net present value of project = 25,210  
Not as great a margin as the table above  

Internal rate of return (IRR):  
single percentage figure for return on investment  
IRR is worked out from the DCF/NPV calculations - what discount rate would we have to use to get a net present value of zero after five years  
Excel has an automated function to do this  
IRR does not take into account the overall size of the project, so that the project with the smaller IRR may produce more actual pounds.  
Therefore DCF/NPV is the best emthod for assessing the value but manager like the simplicity of IRR  

#### Presentation of a business case:  
- think about the audience - try to address the concerns of the decision makers  
- keep it short - these are busy managers  
- tell them what you're going to tell them -> tell them -> tell them what you've told them  

RAID and CARDI LOGS:
