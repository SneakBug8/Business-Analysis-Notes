#### As IT solutions are often investigated by business analysts they should also possess an understanding of IT fundamentals, including areas such as:  

- how computers work including operating systems, application software, hardware and networks  
- systems development lifecycles, for example the unified process or the ‘V’ model  
- systems modelling approaches such as the Unified Modeling Language (UML)  
- systems development approaches, for example, the Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM) and Scrum  
- the relative pros and cons of developing systems instead of buying them off the shelf  
- trends and new opportunities that IT brings such as big data, software as a service, visualisation, mobile technologies, and how these impact systems and business development.
