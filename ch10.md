# Establishing the Requirements  

### Requirements Engineering (RE):  
Agile creates new pressures on top of tight timescales and tight budgets.  
High-level requirements are required right from the start but the level of detail for those requirements evolves 'just in time'.  

`For example, at the beginning of a project, the requirements document may contain
some high-level process models and a set of general business and technical requirements,
supplemented by a use case diagram showing the scope of the proposed IT system. Once initial
requirements have been prioritised, outline use case descriptions can be developed for the highpriority
requirements and then more detailed requirements regarding the solution can be
elaborated later during development.`  

### Why?  
`A business case documents benefits and justifies resources`  
Includes results of needs asssessment and findings previously discovered with key stakeholders  
Living document - adjusts over time to align with organisational objectives  
Prevents creep (which in turn prevents cost overruns, delays and rework)  

### Vision:  
`An idealistic view of the desired outcome`  
- What will the result look like to the stakeholders?  
- Project charter which formally intiates the project will contain the vision  
**Why:** Vision, mission, and goals to be delivered by the result.  
**What:** Objectives identified in the business case. Initial scope boundaries. What is out of scope.  
**Who:** Key internal and external stakeholders.  
**When:** Expected start and end date.  
**Where:** The work or deployment sites of the final solution.  
**How:** Collection of approaches that are recommended. Include predictive and adaptive methods.  

### Scope:  
**Project Scope:**  
All deliverables and efforts required to complete the project effort (responsibilities of the PM).  
**Product Scope:**  
Features and functions that the opportunity or problem will include (responsibilities of the BA).  

The role of the BA is to ensure the PM and the Project Team are fully aware of the requirements and vision so that they can focus on getting the solution delivered.  

### Why and where do projects fail?  

- over 80% of errors are introduced at the requirments analysis stage  
- fewer than 10% of errors are introduced at the development stage (devs are programming correctly but often not programming the right things)  
- most project time is allocated to development and testing  
- less than 12% of the project time is allocated to Requirements Analysis stage  
- poor alignemnt of the developed system to business strategy and objectives  
- poor requirements management  

### Types of Requirements:  
- **Business:**
Higher-level needs of org  
Identified in needs assessment  
Reason for project justification and selection  
- **Stakeholder:**  
Internal needs  
External needs (customers, suppliers, partners, etc.)  
- **Solution:**  
Feature, functions and characteristics of a result  
Functional and non-functional requirements  
- **Transition:**  
Activities needed to move from current state (as-is) to the desired future state (to-be)  
Training, documentation, licensing, conversion adn implementation.  
- **Project:**  
*PM's responsibility*  
Specified by agreements or internal procedures.  
Include processes, deliverables needed to complete on time (management reviews, status updates, performance reports)  
- **Quality:**  
*QA's responsibility*  
Include the conditions or capability used to assess conformance to requirements.  

#### Typical problems with requirements:  
- lack of relevance to the objectives of the project  
- lack of clarity in the wording  
- ambiguity  
- duplication and overlap across requirements  
- conflict between requirements  
- difficulty in assessment as to whether or not requirements have been achieved  
- requirements assuming a solution  
- uncertainty amongst business users about what the need from the new system  
- business users failing to identify all requirements  
- inconsistent levels of detail  
- business users and analylists taking certain knowledge for granted and failing to ensure common understanding  

#### Terms of Reference:  
Clearly defined TOR are essential to ensure that everyone involved in defining the requirements understands the objectives, scope and constraints within which the project is to be carried out.  
OSCAR:  
**Objectives** - both business and project objectives should be defined  
**Scope** - aspects to be covered and NOT covered (to guard against scope creep), as well as functional areas to be included  
**Constraints** - budget, timescale, standards  
**Authority** - business authority, ultimate arbiter to handle conflicts between business users and their requirements and responsible for accepting deliverables  
**Resources** - people and equipment available to the project  

#### Recognising different stakeholder viewpoints:  
`Depending upon their role in the organisation, one person might see the business
system as supporting the product, while another may think in terms of finding a ‘marketing
solution’; a third may see the system as being customer-focused. All three are describing their
perceptions of the same system, but each sits in his or her own silo, viewing the business from
that one viewpoint. It is up to the business analyst to draw the threads together to view the
system as a whole, and to meet all three perspectives as well as possible.`   

<img src="https://foreignpolicy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/duckrabbit_lb22.jpg?w=625&h=400&quality=90"><img>  

`The business analyst will encounter many duckrabbits during his or her career: a sales director
who sources products to satisfy customer demands sees the company as a sales organisation, while
a finance director who has invested heavily in an in-house manufacturing capability will see a
manufacturing organisation. They are describing the same company, but one sees a duck, the other
a rabbit. Is the company there to provide satisfaction to its customers (a duck) or to sell its
manufactured products (a rabbit)? The analyst or requirements engineer needs to understand all of
these valid perspectives, or ‘world views’ to be sure of capturing more than a one-sided view. 
Recognising the existence of a duckrabbit, or multiple world views, helps to anticipate scoping
issues and potential requirements conflicts before they arise.`

## 10.1 A Framework for Requirements Engineering:  

BA must understand and document requirements carefully to avoid the mistakes and oversights identified above.  

The requirements engineering framework provides a roadmap for developing a well-defined requirements document:  

<img src="https://www.gypthecat.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/RequirementsEngineering-1.jpeg"><img>  

## 10.2 Actors:  

Individual or group who is fulfilling a particular role (business representatives - project team)  

### Business Representatives:  

- Project Manager (PM)  
- Subject Matter Expert (SME)  
- Business users  

- Project Sponsor represents the business and ensures the business objectives are met:  
`to agree the project initiation document that approves the requirements engineering
study;
to deliver the specific and agreed business benefits predicted in the business case;
to make funds and other resources available for the project;
to accept the deliverables at the end of the project;
to approve and sign off the requirements document as a true statement of the business
needs;
to rule on any conflicting requirements where the business analyst cannot negotiate
agreement;
to confirm that the benefits in the business case have been realised as promised.`  

- SME gives business advice regarding requirements:  
`when the requirements cover more than one business function;
the requirements relate to a redesigned business process;
the organisation wishes to introduce a new product or process that the company does
not yet fully understand;
the organisation wishes to adopt the latest industry best practice.`  

SME should have experience and knowledge of industry best practice. Helps a BA distinguish between what the business needs and a user wants. May be internal or external.  
External carries some risks:  
`They may not understand well how this particular company works, and its specific
culture. This may make their preferred approach to the solution inappropriate.
They may be unaware of political undercurrents in the organisation that can affect the
project’s success or otherwise.
They may be regarded as an outsider and so be resented by internal workers who feel
they too have suitable expertise.
There may be no knowledge transfer to internal stakeholders; the skills and knowledge
gained on the project leave the organisation when the consultant SME leaves.`  

- Business Users needs to apply the new business processes and use the new IT system:  
`They are required to describe current procedures and documentation, highlight any
difficulties they experience with current processes and identify new requirements for the system.
They should be able to help the business analyst to define the requirements in detail, by
providing specific, clear information. They will be able to assist with the definition of nonfunctional
requirements that apply to their tasks, although some specific aspects may need
management involvement.`  

### Project Team:  

- Project Manager (PM) 
- BA  
- Developers  

- PM is mindful of the need to meet the business requirements and satisfy the business imperatives. PM reports to Project Sponsor:  
`break the project down into identifiable and measurable pieces of work, each with its
deliverable;
allocate the pieces of work to competent people to perform;
schedule the tasks with their start and end times, recognising dependencies between
tasks;
monitor the progress of the various tasks and be alerted of any likely slippage;
take any corrective action should there be slippage, or risk of non-completion of a task
for any reason;
ensure that the project is completed on time and within the agreed budget.`

- BA carries out the Requirements Engineering work:  
`Their key objective is to ensure that the requirements are well-formed, well-documented,
complete and aligned with the business objectives. Working closely with the business staff, they
gather and analyse the requirements, and are responsible to the sponsor for the quality of the
requirements document.`

Sometimes the PM role is assigned to a BA.  

- Devs check the technical feasibility of the requirements and help BAs appreciate the implications of certain requests.  

## 10.3 Requirements Elicitation:  

Originally Requirements Capture. BA subjects the initial requirements list to careful scrutiny in order to ensure that they are well-formed.  
BA uncovers requirements by drawing out information from users, helping them viaualise the possibilities and articulate their requirements.  

Taking into account the type of knowledge stakeholders are using:  

**Tacit Knowledge**  
Business Users pass on explicit knowledge (procedures and data at the front of their minds) but tacit is what they are unable to explain or articulate:  
- Skills -> Explaining how to carry out actions, using words alone is extremely difficult.  
- Taken-for-granted information -> 'not-worth-mentioning information' (not intentional or malicious - like assuming someone knows to plug in the TV before turning it on)  
- Front-story/Back-story -> framing certain processes in a positive light in order to avoid reflecting badly on the staff or business (be suspicious!)  
- Conceptualising requirements -> providing a visual representation of how busines processes could work.  
- Intuitive understanding -> with experience linear, logical approach is abandoned for intuitive recognition.  

Organisational tacit knowledge include:  
`Norms of behaviour - these evolve over time
Organisational culture - behaviour of management and staff
Organisation stories - shared history, in jokes
Formal and informal networks - discrete groups of workers who may be related by task, department, geographical location etc`

|| Tacit | Explicit |
| - | - | - |
| Individual | skills/values/taken-for-granted knowledge/intuitiveness | task definitions/job descriptions/targets/volumes/frequencies |
| Corporate | norms/back-stroy/culture/networks/organisation history | procedures/style guides/processes/knowledge sharing repositories/manuals/company reports |

Tacit knowledge must be made more explicit. It must be reported and recorded, then desseminated into explicit knowledge.  
Approaches for uncovering tacit knowledge include:  
**apprentice** - shadowing, protocol analysis  
**observe** - observations using the STROBE apporoach (STRuctured Observation of the Business Environment), shadowing  
**recount** - story-telling, scenario  
**enact** - prototype, scenario role-play  

#### Elicitation Technique Evaluation Criteria:  
Type of project  
Type of approach  
Time and budget constraints  
Number and location of stakeholders  
Requirement documentation type and detail required  

#### Building the requirements list:  

| Technique | Explicit knowledge | Tacit Knowledge | Taken-for-granted | Front/back story | Skills | Future Requirements |
| - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| Interviewing | ** | * | * | * | * | * |
| Shadowing | ** | ** | ** | ** | ** | * |
| Workshops | ** | ** | ** | * | * | ** |
| Prototyping | ** | ** | ** | * | ** | ** |
| Scenario Analysis | ** | ** | ** | * | * | ** |
| Protocol Analysis | ** | ** | ** | * | ** | * |

The requirements list is a simple list with requirement, source and comments (added at first pass when each requirement is scrutinised)  
The list is developed following intial interview and is developed further as more requirements are identified.  

## 10.4 Requirements Analysis:  

BA ensures only those requirements that pass the scrutiny will be entered in the document.  
Separation of requirements elicitation from requirements analysis is one of the strengths of requirements engineering.  
During elicitation information is drawn out, tacit knowledge uncovered and requirements identified - during analysis the results are examined.  
Logical thought, organisation and rigour are needed.  
Only requirements that are clearly stated, unambiguous, atomic, feasible, aligned with project objectives, not in conflict wiht any other requirements and not overlapping will be documented.  
Use Case Diagram may be used to define the scope of the system and the features to be delivered.  
Business Case Model may be used to illustrate how the work is to be conducted and the flow of the process.  
Data Model may be used to clarify the data to be held and the business rules to be implemented.  
If the requirements does not fit in these 3 then it probably out of scope.  
Cross-referencing the models to each other and to the requirements will show up any omissions.  

Analysis will raise many additional questions and the requirements may need to be investigated further - creating an iterative cycle of elicitation and analysis.

Requirements analysis includes the following tasks:  
- Categorisation of the requirements:  
First pass - categorise into specific requirement types (general, technical, functional and non-functional)  
Later passes - sub-categories (business area or function, or possibly by use case)  
- Drawing a set of models to check the set of requirements is complete and coherent  
- Applying filters to ensure the requirements are well-defined:  
Checking for overlapping/duplicates  
Unravelling multiple requirements  
Confirming multiple requirements  
Feasibility evaluation (technical, business, financial)  
Removing conflicts  
Checking for solutions  
Confirming standard of quality (clear, concise, consistent, relevant, unambiguious, correct, testable, traceable)

```
We need an ERP system. This is not a functional requirement for an inventory
system, it is a strategic decision about the nature of the solution. The requirements
phase is concerned with finding out the individual business requirements that such
a system (if it were to be implemented) must satisfy.
2. We need to print off a list of expected deliveries. This is both vague (what
deliveries? How soon before they are expected? Just the fact of a delivery, or crossreferencing
with the orders? Listing the items to be delivered?) and a solution. The
actual requirement is to produce an alert of the deliveries due within the specific
time period (today, this week, this afternoon). The business requirement is not to
print the notice. That might well be a good solution, but to put that into the
requirement immediately disqualifies other, possibly better, solutions.
3. We need to cross-check orders against deliveries. This is unclear – what orders?
Deliveries in or out? Cross-check for what? What is actually the business need?
4. We need to supersede an item. There is obviously a business function to supersede
one item of inventory with another, but it is not clear what the requirement is from
this project. This reads like a high-level requirement, and needs a lot of work to
understand what information support is needed, which will be translated into a set
of lower-level functional requirements.
5. The system must record the fulfilment of a purchase order on delivery of the goods.
This sounds a clear statement of a business need.
6. The system must automatically re-calculate re-order quantity (RoQ). While this
appears to be a clear requirements statement, it sounds a technically complex
operation, with a series of variables to calculate and does not specify at what point
the RoQ takes place. We need to investigate why it must be done automatically and
when it should be done, and estimate how long it will take to design and
implement, in case it proves not to be feasible in our timescales.
7. The stores controller must have the facility to adjust re-order quantity. This sounds
as though it might conflict with item 6. Clearly they want to alter RoQ, but who is
responsible – is this a political issue? Return 6 and 7 for negotiation.
8. We need to create and delete contractors. This is a statement of two separate
requirements.
9. We need to return damaged items. Not clear what IS support they are asking for
with this function. What exactly is the requirement?
10. We need more accurate stock levels. This is both imprecise and a complaint about
service rather than a requirement. We need to investigate the problem of inaccurate
levels. It may be a process or people issue.
```  

Unrealistic or conflicting requirements are still included in the catalogue to be considered (this keeps an audit of all requirements raised)  

**SMART** (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time framed) should be applied to all requirements on the list.  

## 10.5 Requirements Validation:  

External stakeholders review the requirements in order to agree and sign off the requirements document.  
A review group is formed that will be responsible for checking the requirements document and confirming its suitability.  
- Business sponsor -> ensures the requirements are all in alignment with the business objectives and within the scope  
- Businesss owners of individual requirements -> last opportunity to be satisfied with the requirements before accepting them  
- SME -> should review the requirements to ensure the reflect correct business practice  
- Devs -> should review the requirements to ensure they are technically feasible  
- Testers -> should review the requirements to ensure that they are testable  
- Project office representiatives -> should ensure that the requirements are compliant with business standards and policies  

Formal meeting, virtual meeting - any is better than none.  
Key stakeholders are often very busy so the document must be easy to navigate.  
There are 3 possible outcomes:  
1. Requirements document is confirmed as satisfactory and is signed off or baselined.  
2. Requirements document requires some amendment and, once completed can be signed off.  
3. Requirements document needs significant reqork and should be reviewed again before sign off.  

Agile Approach to requirements:  
Traceability feature allows all changes to the requirements to be incorporated into the document with reasons for changes in case of query or conflict later on.  
Waterfall (incremental) aims to produce a baselined set of good, complete, relevant well-formed requirements before a solution is specified and designed; this ensures that the development is driven by business requirements, and not by the technology.  
Agile follows a practice of evolving the requirements during development. Could lead to scope creep but does remove redundant work involved in specifying requirements early on, only to see them change.  

### Agile:  
Ususally begins with an intensive workshop - outcome being the scope, a set of high-level requirements, a priority for implementing the requirements and some way of representing which actors need to interact with the system.  
User stories can be employed here but usually it is a use case diagram.  


### Requirements documentation:  
Is concerned with the development of a well-organised requirements document.  

### Requirements management:  
Covers the activities needed to manage any changes to the requirements.
