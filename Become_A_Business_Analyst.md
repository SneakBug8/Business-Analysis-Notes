## Become a Business Analyst  

### What is Business Analysis  
#### What is BA?  
Process by which we identify business needs, recommend relevant solutions and understand requirements.  
What's being done and why? Is there a better way to do it? Are rules being followed? Are exceptions being made? Should the rules even exist? Are we being as efficient as possible?  

#### BA Industry Definitions  
`Business Analysis is the practice of enabling change in an organizational context, by defining needs and recommending solutions that deliver value to stakeholders. - IIBA`  

`Identifying business needs. Recommending relevant solutions. Working with stakeholders to elicit requirements. Analyzing, defining, documenting and managing requirements. BAs help to shape the outcome of projects to ensure they deliver business benefits. - PMI`  

BAs seek to identify and understand business needs and provide solutions to enable change.  

#### What is the role of a BA?  
Focused on understanding the current needs, and goals of the organisation.  
Help product team members understand their customers needs better.  
Help craft strategic objectives - the BA has to explain the solution.  
They see how opportunities fit into the overall strategy of the org. They understand and explain the reasons why projects where chosen.  

#### BA Skillset  
Expert judgement - BA is more knowledgeable about the organisation or industry and they can help identify and analyse alternative solutions for a problem.  
Analytical skills - breaking problems down into smaller parts which can be individually assessed.  
Extracting the relevant from the trivial - critical thinking, system thinking, learning skills and problem solving.  
Communication - may take up to 80% of a BAs time such as facilitation, visual and presentation skills, active listening, awareness of your nonverbal behaviour, written skills.   
Leadership - working with others as an agent of change - communicating problems and solutions to organisational leaders.  
Operate between AND within departments.  
Attention to detail and a keen investigative eye.  

### Doing a Needs Assessment  
#### Needs Assessment Basics  
Needs fall into one of three categories:  
Problems or possible improvements - important to understand what the problem is, the impact that it has on the org, and a potential solution.  
Opportunities or new endeavours - allow an organisation to grow and expand, BA helps to focus those opportunities.  
Compliance requirements - all orgs are subject to internal and external rules.  
1. Identify what the problems is that needs to be solved.  
2. Identify the current (as-is) state (beware of analysis paralysis where you just keep analysing and not stopping to generate a solution).  
3. Identify the gap between the as-is and the to-be state (if the gaps are alrge then there may need to be an iterative journey to close them).  

#### Situation and Solution Statements  
Document findings in order to prioritise what needs to be done.  
Situation statement - what the situation was and the impact on the organisation.  
1. Current problem to be solved in a structured manner.  
2. Identifies the impact of the situations on the org.  
*The problem/opportunity has the effect of x on y.*  
Critical to review with key stakeholders to ensure that we have captured the situation correctly so that the proposed solution address the real problem/opportunity.  
Ishikawa (Fishbone) diagram is used to understand the situation.  
5 Whys  
Models of flow of process to identify problems (might just need to adjust the process without needing additional resources)  
Solution is developed to deliver measurable business value - fix, new product, enhancement to existing product.  
Solution defines the initial scope and possible steps to move from as-is to to-be.  
Feasibility study may be needed before final solution is published - reviewing operational capability (is it technically feasible, financially, etc.)  

### Identifying Stakeholders  
#### Who are stakeholders?  
`Any individual, group or organization that may be affected by or perceive itself to be affected by, or can impact a decision, activity, or outcome of a program or project.`  
In the BAs case - anyone who might be affected by the changes we make (those who proposed whanges, those who will be affected, those who will beenfit, or not, from the changes).  The BA needs to be aware of, and anticipate what impact they may have on the project - it's important that we know who we are impacting, and who may have an impact on us.  

#### Classifying your stakeholders  
<img src="https://www.mindtools.com/media/Diagrams/stakeholder-analysis-figure1-2020.jpg"><img>  
Power = ability to affect the project  
Interest = their perception of how the project will affect them  
Low power/High interest - working with the problem area (they're affected but don't typically have the power to make the changes)  
High power = executives and upper management (usually lower in interest and just want to know the bottom line)  
Low power/Low interest = usually assigned because they're not busy or management doesn't know what else to do with them (warm bodies).  
High power/High interest = need a lot of attention. They can suggest changes, as they eprceive the changes that will affect them.  
Assess whether your stakeholders have access to resources? Can they provide the data you need? Do they have decision-making power? Can they provide the perspective and insight on the activities that are being assessed? Can they help with the completetion of the analysis and required documentation?  

#### Engaging stakeholders  
The more involvement stakeholders have with the work to deliver the outcome, the better chance we have that they'll be supportive of the result.  
By engaging them in the development of the solution, they often have a better understanding of the why this change is necessary and can help with the transition to the future state.  
If they do not understand the necessity for the change, they may be more apt to resist the final result.  
Each stakeholder or group wil require a customised plan for engagement.  
Topics for engagement include: goals, objectives, scope boundaries.  
Agree with stakeholders on engagement:
Format - email, phone, F2F, meeting, 121  
Content - Type, level of detail, which details?  
Timing - Time frame, frequency  
We have to understand the reason that specific information is required at that time and what the expected result or impact will be upon receipt.  
Continual monitoring of the involvement of stakeholders is important. This allows us to determine why involvement may have changed and whether additional may have changed and whether additional engagements are needed.  

**Pro Tip:**  
Figure out how much time you need for individual stakeholders, especially those that are executives, then pre-schedule them for the times when you need them. Reserve dates and times for meetings with these stakeholders. They're going to be surprised by how much of their time you really need. You need to continually remind them though of their importance to the result of the project. By the end of the project, you want to make sure they feel their engagement was well worth the time spent.

### Creating a Business Case  
#### Purpose of a Business Case  
The business case developed by those requesting a solution is usually developed to help with a justification.  
The time and effort required to develop it though should be consistent with the size and importance of the solution being justified.  
It will include the results of the needs assessment and findings previously discovered with key stakeholders from the organizations impacted.  
It helps ensure that the project remains aligned with the organizational objectives. This is especially important when organizational objectives change (could be canceled).  
Not all organisations require business cases. Some require it for capital expenditures.  
When a business case is developed and reviewed as part of a portfolio management process, it becomes a valuable input to the initiating of the project or initiative.  
It provides valuable information of the business need and the proposed solution - prevents scope creep (which results in delays, cost overruns and rework)  
Documents the benfits and justifies resources (people, supplies, equipment, finances)  

#### Content of a Business Case  
Business Needs:  
Situation Statement (identified needs)  
Identification of key stakeholders  
Initital scope of proposed project  
Previous Analysis of the Situation Under Consideration:  
Organisational strategies, goal, objectives which will be supported by this effort.  
Analysis of the situation and root cause of the problem.  
Supporting data for a new opportunity.  
CSFs to be met.  
Gap analysis of as-is state and desired future state.  
High-level risk assessments, assumptions, constraints and regulations.  
Alternative implementation options and approaches.  
High-level milestones, dependencies, roles, responsibilities and risks.  
Benefit measurements (payback period, net present value, internal rate of return, depreciation, cost-benefit analysis, ROI)  

### Planning the Project  
#### Project Planning: Vision  
Idealistic view of the desired outcome - helps us stay on task and remain oriented to the business value that is driving the project.  
Shared vision should be built by the sponsor, the PM, the BAs and the key stakeholders.  
The Project Charter contains the project vision (which contains the why, what, who, where, when and how of the project)  
**Why** - this is the vision, mission and goals that are to be delivered by the result.  
**What** - Objectives identified in the business case and initial boundaries for scope, what is NOT included.  
**Who** - Key stakeholders, both internally and externally, who will play key roles in the project.  
**When** - The expected start and end dates. This is especially important when a final date is imposed or window of opportunity constraint exists.  
**Where** - The work or deployment sites of the final solution.  
**How** - The collection of various approaches, including predictive or adaptive methods, that are recommended.  
Elevator pitch - pitch the vision in one or two statements.  

#### Project Planning: Project Roadmap  
The roadmap is a chronological representation of features and functions, but, also, the dependencies between major milestones and resource requirements.  
Provides transparency - everyone can see it and know where the project is - and what is coming next.  
A roadmap is very similar to a project schedule, where timeframes for major activities are shown. The schedule, though, is used to plan and develop the more detailed activities.  
The roadmap is merely a communication tool to show the expected delivery timeframes for benefits and results.  
The roadmap is a key technique for adaptive projects, it enables the project to adapt to changing organizational objectives.  

#### Project Planning: Responsibilities  
Project Scope:  
All the deliverables and effort required to complete the project - responsibility of the PM.  
Product Scope:  
Features and function that the problem will include - responsibility of the BA.  
Identification and analysis of key stakeholders and planning activities are responsibilities of both PM and BA.  
The BA should provide the project manager with two things - a list of activities needed to elicit, analyze, and evaluate requirements and the activities for tracing, verifying, and validating those requirements. The business analyst then takes these to develop the business analysis plan.  
The plan contains the needed activities to be done and the business analysis deliverables that might be required.  
BA must get a clear understanding of the requirements and exceptions from the stakeholder or product owner. 
Once the requirements have been identified, the BA fits them into the requirements baseline or release iteration backlog.  

### Determining Requirements  
#### Requirement Types  
Six major categories of requirements:  
Business - They represent the higher level needs of the organization. Usually, business requirements are identified through the needs assessment process as either issues or opportunities. They're the reason why the project was selected and justified in the first place.  
Stakeholder - These requirements could come from within the organization, internally, or from customers, suppliers, partners, or other external organizations.  
Solution - Features, functions and characteristics of the result (what the customer wants). Functional (what the user will eba ble to do or what they'll receive) or non-functional (environment or quality of service conditions. Technology requirements).  
Transition - Activities to help transition from the current state to the desired future state. These include training, documentation, and possibly conversion and implementation requirements.  
Project - Processes and deliverables to ensure the project is delivered on time - responsibility of PM.  
Quality - Conditions or capability used to assess conformance to the requirements. - responsibility of Quality Analyst.  

#### Requirements Elicitation Techniques  
Facilitated sessions - facilitator guides the conversation of the participants, prompts brainstorming, and makes sure that the session fulfills its goal.  
Can be used throughout the project and bring cross-fucntional participants together.  
Diverse participants naturally uncover gaps, redundancies, needs and other important information.  
Interviews (structured, semi-structured or informal) are most appropriate when confidential or sensitive information is needed, or the information is needed from high level managers.  
Collect and analyse existing documentation.  
Ask WHY - the answer, 'because it's always been done that way' is not enough.  
Shadowing, surveys (open ended questions) for large groups.  
Constrain to 2 phases - 1 during needs assessment phase and 1 after the prject has been initiated.  
Consider: the type of project and approach used, time and budget constraints, number and location of stakeholders, and requirement documentation type and detail required.  

#### Using Requirements Modeling Techniques  
`I as a customer want to order a camera to take photos of my family`  
to order =  verb  
camera = noun  
Process modeling (verbs) - to understand the various steps required.  
Data modeling (nouns) - adding products.  
Rules - discuss with stakeholders to find rules and relationships between nouns and verbs.  
F2F discussion with stakeholders at a whiteboard. Find verbs, then nouns.   

**Pro Tip**  
Stickies are an effective way to show the differences. In this case, between different types of customers and cameras. Once identified, these rules identify the steps that apply for individual customers as well as any pricing discounts that might apply. The models will help you analyze requirements individually, but the real power comes from bringing it all together. Fragments of requirements still help you know what steps are needed to fulfill an order request, which exact product is being requested, what price is being charged depending on the product and the customer, etc.

If you can map everything together, you'll be able to deliver a solution that exceeds the customer's expectations while still following the rules established by the organization.  

### Traceabililty and Monitoring Requirements  
#### Traceability Matrix and Task Board  
Traceability Approach: Way of thinking about how requirements are related and tracking them.  
The project team should be able to trace a single requirement to its supporting objectives and other related requirements. It also allows for the visibility of progress on individual requirements. It exposes obstacles that are preventing requirements from progressing and allows appropriate actions to be taken to remove them.  

Traceability Matrix: How you use the traceability approach to track your project.  
Scrum board, Kanban board, Trello board etc.  
Typically the columns are labeled To-Do, In Progress, and Done. Now, the In Progress column could be further subdivided to show phases of the organization's methodology, including, maybe, analysis, design, development, tests, etc.  
Connections between requirements and objectives are visualised and moved between defined columns.  
Digital document used to consolidate all of your documentation in one place.  
These may include use cases, analysis models, design documents, test plans, cases, and results. Acceptance sign-offs are also often included. The more detailed traceability matrix often has a space dedicated to linking high-level requirements, also referred to as features or epics, to smaller user stories.  

As new requirements are approved or old requirements deemed unnecessary, they're added to, or removed from the traceability matrix. You trace them as they are implemented. Now, the amount of detail you include is dependent on the size, complexity, and importance of the project. Also note that you can certainly have a task board as well, but the traceability matrix acts as the central hub for information.  

#### Change Control  
Most organizations have a process in place to handle changes. This includes a way to receive and log all requests, regardless of the type or source of the request. Those requests are then analyzed and the importance and impact to the work in progress, helps determine what the next steps will be.  
This process is often documented in the Requirements Management Plan.  

Part of the overall area of change also includes a plan for configuration control. Tracking of change to documents or processes via version control - make sure that when changes are made, everyone is made aware of the change and that the most recent version is being used. and that the most recent version is being used.  

### Evaluating the Solution  
#### Testing and Verification  
The initial verification of the requirements is done through the continued collaboration with stakeholders. This may be part of the initial needs assessment or the review of the situation and solution statements - make sure the requirements properly represetn the needs of the stakeholders.  
Making sure the appropraite detail and acceptance criteria has been gathered for each requirement.  
For predictive approach, this verification is often performed as part of a formal review of a requirement specification document.  
For adaptive approaches, this verification is most often done through collaborative conversations and possible modeling activities between the stakeholder, the business analyst, and the implementation team member.  

Various levels of testing are performed to provide verification that the requirements meets the specification provided. These procedures and tests are often defined as part of the development methodology of the organization or the project's quality management plan.  

Cost of quality - understanding how much testing is needed (reviewing the activities needed to prevent or appraise conformance or nonconformance, or failure).  

#### Validation  
Final step that each requirement must go through - validation and acceptance of the result.  
Verification - check conformance to the specifgications that were provided.  
Validation - confirming the result meets the acceptance criteria and the needs of the stakeholder.  

Acceptance Criteria - can be identified when the requirement or user story is being written but a more effective method of understanding the criteria to be used for acceptance is through continuous discussion and review between the business analyst, the developer, and the stakeholder as the result is being developed.  

RACI format (responsibility matrix) helps here to identify the approving stakeholder for each requirement.  
Also, helps to see if other stakeholders should be included or consulted in the validation process, as well as those who need to be informed of the status of the approval process.  

### Preparing for Release and Transition  
#### Release Planning  
Release - product, service, result or solution being delivered to the client in a specified time.  
Release is planned for when the roadmap is being designed - the milestones form a rough draft of the order of the releases. These milestones affect the selection of user stories and the detailed planning of sprints.  
Can the result be delivered in stages? If so, which can be delivered first?  
Who is the result being delivered to?  
A hierarchy of requirements is created according to feasibility and value and the requirements get chunked into realeases.  
The items in the planned release are then prioritised by the stakeholder and the project team.  
Release planning is high-level sprint planning. Sprint planning is more concrete, lower-level and time-boxed.  

**Pro Tip:**  
You have a jar and some rocks. You need to fill the jar. You have big rocks, small rocks, and sand. If you put the sand in first, and then the small rocks, you probably won't have room for the big rocks. But if you put the big rocks in first, then the small rocks, and then the sand, it's more than likely that you'll have room for everything. That's what we want to do with our planning. We want to make sure the big rocks get in the jar first. The big rocks are those high priority requirements. The small rocks and sand, lower priority. So bottom line, put the big rocks in first.  

#### Transition Planning  
The transition is where the BA, the stakeholder and the team are handing the result to the client.  
The release is the what (and when), the transition is the how (how the solution will be implemented in the organisation).  
How is this going to be placed within the organisation:  
Training  
Data conversion  
etc.  
Transition plans help ensure the success of the product (instead of throwing it over the fence and shouting 'Good luck!')  
Pilot programming could be built into the plan - enabling the discovery of adjustments that may need to be done before full deployment.  
If new software is replacing old then they may need to run in parallel to ensure the results are correct.  
This isn't always possible and usually the Big Bang approach is taken - remove old method and totally replace it with the new.  
Regardless of the approach, you need to provide new or updated training and documentation for the receiving organization.  
Training needs to be provided as part of the transition but also after, for new staff that join later.  
Be sensitive - the solution isn't old to the BA anymore (who ahs been dealing with this for weeks/months.) but it will be new for the recipients - aniticipate pain points and resistance.  

#### Implementation Planning  
BA is left behind to work directly with the org to ensure the solution is used and meets the original expectations.  
Change is often met with resistance - especially if there is substantial changes to how they have always been doing it.  
The acceptance of the change needs to be continually evaluated.  
Shadowing to ensure the result is being implemented, identifying things which need fixing and possible future requirements.  
The solution often only fixes a portion of the problem - future enhancements can be identified after implementation.  
The support for the actual implementation the result often includes additional funds and resources - internal or external helpdesk for software.  
This support group may not only require additional and ongoing funding, but often requires specific documentation and training. The BA sets up the support team and provides them with information about the solution.  
The change might also require individual coaching and support by either key business people or the BA.  
Track the results of the changes made to help determine if the expected results are being delivered. The process of tracking and reporting should have been included in any transition and implementation planning.
