## Become a Business Analyst  

### What is Business Analysis  
#### What is BA?  
Process by which we identify business needs, recommend relevant solutions and understand requirements.  
What's being done and why? Is there a better way to do it? Are rules being followed? Are exceptions being made? Should the rules even exist? Are we being as efficient as possible?  

#### BA Industry Definitions  
`Business Analysis is the practice of enabling change in an organizational context, by defining needs and recommending solutions that deliver value to stakeholders. - IIBA`  

`Identifying business needs. Recommending relevant solutions. Working with stakeholders to elicit requirements. Analyzing, defining, documenting and managing requirements. BAs help to shape the outcome of projects to ensure they deliver business benefits. - PMI`  

BAs seek to identify and understand business needs and provide solutions to enable change.  

#### What is the role of a BA?  
Focused on understanding the current needs, and goals of the organisation.  
Help product team members understand their customers needs better.  
Help craft strategic objectives - the BA has to explain the solution.  
They see how opportunities fit into the overall strategy of the org. They understand and explain the reasons why projects where chosen.  

#### BA Skillset  
Expert judgement - BA is more knowledgeable about the organisation or industry and they can help identify and analyse alternative solutions for a problem.  
Analytical skills - breaking problems down into smaller parts which can be individually assessed.  
Extracting the relevant from the trivial - critical thinking, system thinking, learning skills and problem solving.  
Communication - may take up to 80% of a BAs time such as facilitation, visual and presentation skills, active listening, awareness of your nonverbal behaviour, written skills.   
Leadership - working with others as an agent of change - communicating problems and solutions to organisational leaders.  
Operate between AND within departments.  
Attention to detail and a keen investigative eye.  

### Doing a Needs Assessment  
#### Needs Assessment Basics  
Needs fall into one of three categories:  
Problems or possible improvements - important to understand what the problem is, the impact that it has on the org, and a potential solution.  
Opportunities or new endeavours - allow an organisation to grow and expand, BA helps to focus those opportunities.  
Compliance requirements - all orgs are subject to internal and external rules.  
1. Identify what the problems is that needs to be solved.  
2. Identify the current (as-is) state (beware of analysis paralysis where you just keep analysing and not stopping to generate a solution).  
3. Identify the gap between the as-is and the to-be state (if the gaps are alrge then there may need to be an iterative journey to close them).  

#### Situation and Solution Statements  
Document findings in order to prioritise what needs to be done.  
Situation statement - what the situation was and the impact on the organisation.  
1. Current problem to be solved in a structured manner.  
2. Identifies the impact of the situations on the org.  
*The problem/opportunity has the effect of x on y.*  
Critical to review with key stakeholders to ensure that we have captured the situation correctly so that the proposed solution address the real problem/opportunity.  
Ishikawa (Fishbone) diagram is used to understand the situation.  
5 Whys  
Models of flow of process to identify problems (might just need to adjust the process without needing additional resources)  
Solution is developed to deliver measurable business value - fix, new product, enhancement to existing product.  
Solution defines the initial scope and possible steps to move from as-is to to-be.  
Feasibility study may be needed before final solution is published - reviewing operational capability (is it technically feasible, financially, etc.)  

### Identifying Stakeholders  
#### Who are stakeholders?  
`Any individual, group or organization that may be affected by or perceive itself to be affected by, or can impact a decision, activity, or outcome of a program or project.`  
In the BAs case - anyone who might be affected by the changes we make (those who proposed whanges, those who will be affected, those who will beenfit, or not, fomr the changes).  The BA needs to be aware of, and anticipate what impact they may have on the project - it's important that we know who we are impacting, and who may have an impact on us.  

#### Classifying your stakeholders  
<img src="https://www.mindtools.com/media/Diagrams/stakeholder-analysis-figure1-2020.jpg"><img>  
Power = ability to affect the project  
Interest = their perception of how the project will affect them  
Low power/High interest - working with the problem area (they're affected but don't typically have the power to make the changes)  
High power = executives and upper management (usually lower in interest and just want to know the bottom line)  
Low power/Low interest = usually assigned because they're not busy or management doesn't know what else to do with them (warm bodies).  
High power/High interest = need a lot of attention. They can suggest changes, as they eprceive the changes that will affect them.  
Assess whether your stakeholders have access to resources? Can they provide the data you need? Do they have decision-making power? Can they provide the perspective and insight on the activities that are being assessed? Can they help with the completetion of the analysis and required documentation?  

#### Engaging stakeholders  
The more involvement stakeholders have with the work to deliver the outcome, the better chance we have that they'll be supportive of the result.  
By engaging them in the development of the solution, they often have a better understanding of the why this change is necessary and can help with the transition to the future state.  
If they do not understand the necessity for the change, they may be more apt to resist the final result.  
Each stakeholder or group wil require a customised plan for engagement.  
Topics for engagement include: goals, objectives, scope boundaries.  
Agree with stakeholders on engagement:
Format - email, phone, F2F, meeting, 121  
Content - Type, level of detail, which details?  
Timing - Time frame, frequency  
We have to understand the reason that specific information is required at that time and what the expected result or impact will be upon receipt.  
Continual monitoring of the involvement of stakeholders is important. This allows us to determine why involvement may have changed and whether additional may have changed and whether additional engagements are needed.  
**Pro Tip:**  
Figure out how much time you need for individual stakeholders, especially those that are executives, then pre-schedule them for the times when you need them. Reserve dates and times for meetings with these stakeholders. They're going to be surprised by how much of their time you really need. You need to continually remind them though of their importance to the result of the project. By the end of the project, you want to make sure they feel their engagement was well worth the time spent.

### Creating a Business Case  
#### Purpose of a Business Case  
The business case developed by those requesting a solution is usually developed to help with a justification.  
The time and effort required to develop it though should be consistent with the size and importance of the solution being justified.  
It will include the results of the needs assessment and findings previously discovered with key stakeholders from the organizations impacted.  
It helps ensure that the project remains aligned with the organizational objectives. This is especially important when organizational objectives change (could be canceled).  
Not all organisations require business cases. Some require it for capital expenditures.  
When a business case is developed and reviewed as part of a portfolio management process, it becomes a valuable input to the initiating of the project or initiative.  
It provides valuable information of the business need and the proposed solution - prevents scope creep (which results in delays, cost overruns and rework)  
Documents the benfits and justifies resources (people, supplies, equipment, finances)  

#### Content of a Business Case

Situation Statement (identified needs)  
Identification of key stakeholders  
Initital scope of proposed project  
Previous Analysis of the Situation Under Consideration:

Analysis of the situation and root cause of the problem.  
Supporting data for a new opportunity.  
CSFs to be met.  
Gap analysis of as-is state and desired future state.  
High-level risk assessments, assumptions, constraints and regulations.  
Alternative implementation options and approaches.  
High-level milestones, dependencies, roles, responsibilities and risks.  
Benefit measurements (payback period, net present value, internal rate of return, depreciation, cost-benefit analysis, ROI)
