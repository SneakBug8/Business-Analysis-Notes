## Defining the Solution:  

- key activity = analysing the gap between where the business is now and where it needs to be  

### Gap Analysis:  
- exploring the differences between a current state and a desired state  
- BAM provides a conceptual overview of a desired future business system (showing what activities would be needed)  
- explores the 'as-is' and 'to-be' business process models  
- explores the competencies held by and individual and those required for a particular role  
- explores the IT system requirements and features offered by a software package  

#### Identifying areas of concern:  
- operating satisfactorily -> no immediate action needed  
- some issues to be addressed -> action required  
- not in place -> urgent consideration  

This categorisation allows BAs to prioritise the work in line wiht the original objectives  

#### Framework for Gap Analysis:  
- holistic approach avoids issues such as change proposals failing to address real problems  
- when taking a holistic approach, the analysts ensure that they consider aspects such as the organisationâ€™s structure, culture and management style in addition to examining the business processes and IT systems.  
 - **POPIT** (People -> Organistaion -> Processes -> IT):
 
**Processes**  
- start considering 'as-is' and 'to-be' processes  
- many changes here will need other elements of POPIT to change  

**IT**  
- retireval and distribution of information very important so gaps often found here  
- document analysis and modelling (entity relationship models and class diagrams) are useful here  
- technology is often to core enabler of the business change  
- IT support - many organisations are constrinated by legacy systems which are note very adaptable or scalable  
- IT Accessibility - if staff have difficulty using systems they will develop unauthorised and undesirable workarounds in order to conduct their work  
- IT aligning with enterprise architecture - need to be well integrated with each other   

**Organisation**  
- gaps can exist here that undermine the new business system and processes  
- 7-S Model (Structure - Systems - Style -Staff -Skills - Strategy - Shared Value) provides a framework  
- POPIT covers sytems (process, IT) and staff and skills (people)  
- shared values - are core values explicit and communicated?  

**People**  
- communicating changes to affected staff is very important  
- analysis should consider impact and identify gaps  
- SKILLS - what skills do the new jobs require (training, new information, new rules, new triggers)  
- STAFF DEVELOPMENT - how are the current personal development processes working?  
- MOTIVATION - if there is a problem with motivation then new systems won't help - it might be that a rewards systems needs to be introduced  

### Formulating options:  
- proposals must be feasible from a financial, business and technological point of view  
- must be holistic - no point in changing one or two elements and ignoring the others  

### Defining business Requirements:  
- outcome of gap analysis is a list of business requirements that need to be delivered  
- 'what' level rather than dictating the precise ways in which they will be delivered   

## Business Architecture:  
A blueprint of the enterprise that provides a common understanding of the organisation that can be used to align strategic objectives and tactical demands.  

This definition encapsulates the important role that the business architecture plays as an interface between strategy and the implementation of change. Hence, employed effectively, a robust business architecture results in the following:  

- the strategy drives changes to the business architecture;  
- the business architecture informs and refines the strategy;  
- the business architecture translates the strategy for execution;  
- the strategy execution enables and generates improvement to the overall business architecture.  

A business architecture has three primary objectives:  

1. To promote organisational health: to ensure the longevity and well-being of the organisation, generating an ability to be flexible and agile in the delivery of change.  
2. To help fulfil unrealised opportunities: promoting appropriate reaction to external influences and proposed initiatives, and identifying the areas of the business which would most benefit from any transformation.  
3. To aid organisational performance in a competitive market place: implementing best practice, encouraging reuse, monitoring business metrics and focusing on those areas of the business that deliver the most value to the end customer.  

In addition, it is worth keeping in mind the following key points about a business architecture:  

- The scope of a business architecture is the scope of the business.  
- A business architecture is not prescriptive.  
- A business architecture is developed iteratively.  
- A business architecture is reusable across business units and businesses.  
- A business architecture is not about the deliverables, it is more concerned with reflecting the underlying philosophy and values.  

- businesses should have a formal definition of the architecture of their business 
- any proposed changes must align with this  
- even small changes affect multiple processes, IT systems and databases -> having an overall blueprint will help assess how small changes affect the overall structure 

### Structure of business architecture:  
Evolving best practice has shown that the key elements of a business architecture represent the following areas:  

- business motivations;  
- business capabilities;  
- value streams (which can be mapped to more detailed business processes);  
- organisational business units;  
- information concepts.  

From this list, the business capabilities and the value streams that enable them, are widely regarded as the essence of an effective business architecture; it is with these artefacts that the construction of a business architecture should always begin. Business analysts can use the artefacts to ensure that any work they undertake and changes they propose, are consistent with the business architecture. Also, the business analysts may add to the business architecture over time in order to extend its coverage. This would be done within a robust governance regime to ensure continued consistency and correctness of the business architecture artefacts.

BUSINESS ARCHITECTURE TECHNIQUES
There is a wide range of techniques that can be employed when defining the business architecture. These techniques vary from those that focus on the bigger picture of the business architecture, such as business model definition, business motivation analysis and capability modelling, through to more detailed techniques such as value stream analysis, value network analysis and information mapping.

The two key techniques from this list that form the essence of an effective Business Architecture are:

business capability modelling;
value stream analysis.

BUSINESS CAPABILITY MODELLING
Capability models represent, at a high level, what the organisation needs to be able to do in order to deliver value to customers. While these initial capabilities can be decomposed to a number of levels, they should never reflect how delivery is actually achieved in practice.

A capability is a particular ability to achieve an outcome and reflects something a business is able to do that creates value for a customer. A full business capability model usually investigates and models the whole organisation across a number of business strata (layers). The main strata found on a typical business capability model would be:

strategic or direction setting;
core or customer facing;
supporting.
