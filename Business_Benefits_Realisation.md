## Understanding Business Benefits  
### Roles in Business Benefits Realisation  
Benefits management begins by defining the portfolio, program, and project objectives and how they align to the organisation's strategic objectives and expected benefits.  
Portfolio Management refers to the centralised management of all the projects being undertaken to achieve the strategic objectives of the organisation.  
Program Management refers to bringing a number of projects together under one program of work.  
Change Management roles are found across the portfolio: portfolio manager, program manager, project manager, business analyst, or the organisational change manager each play a role in determining what the benefits are, the measurements that are needed, and ultimately how the organisation achieves against that strategic objectives.  

### Purpose and Intent of Business Benefits Realisation  
Executives make decisions based on the potential benefits. Once a project is approved, those measurable outcomes and benefits need to be achieved.  
**Five Objectives:**  
- Be specific - Ensure benefits are clearly identified, defind and linked to the strategic outcomes.  
- Clearly define ownership - Ensure business areas are committed to realising their defined benefits and the ownership of the benefits is spelled out including responsibility for adding value through the realisation process.  
- Define the process - Drive the process of realising benefits, including benefit measurement, tracking, and recording benefits as they are realised.  
- Create a plan - Use the defined, expected benefits as a roadmap for the program, providing a focus for delivering change.  
- Ensure benefits are traceable - Provide alignment and clear links between the program vision and desired benefits together with the organisation's strategic objectives.  

Benefits are part of a lifecycle: From strategy, through tactical, to operational.  

### Business Benefits Framework Pillars  
For porjects of all sizes the framwork will assist the organisation to work out what the benefits will be, and how they can be measured, and managed through to realisation.  
The four pillars of the business benefits framework offer the rigour and consistency that is needed to enable and ensure each of the individual projects, then grouped into programs, will deliver the benefit outcomes expected at the portfolio level. The four pillars also provide organisational structure, to enable collection of data in a consistent and standardised way, for reporting at the portfolio level.  

**Four Pillars:**  
- Standards:  
Documented, consistent standards that articulate who is interested in the benefits. It assists stakeholders to transition and define their specific needs. It helps inform their decision making. And it's also a part of the continuous improvement process at the portfolio and program levels.  
- Best Practices:  
Applying this intelligence across an organisation or multiple organisations. Benefits are often realised as a result of multiple projects. The realisation process can also be impacted as the organisation evolves and the business adopts the change.  
- Terms & Categories:  
You need a glossary of terms to ensure that everyone is using the same language and achieving the same meaning. Every organisation will have different benefit types and categories, but they always include these three:  
1. financial. Also known as tangible. These are benefits that can be quantified, and valued in financial terms. For example, cost savings and revenue generation.  
2. nonfinancial. They are benefits that can be quantified but are difficult to value in financial terms. For example, improved resilience.  
3. intangible benefits. These are benefits that can be identified but cannot be easily quantified. For example, end user satisfaction, better access to information, or improved customer service.  
- Guidance:  
Guidance the portfolio, program, and project sponsors, and benefit owners.  

### Business Benefits Framework Process  
Organisations are constantly striving for consistency in the way they execute to enable efficient, accurate, and replicable techniques to achieving outcomes.  
Pillars provide structure and needs a consistent process to enable alignment across the projects, programs, and portfolio benefits.  
**Four Step Process:**  
- Define the benefits:  
Establish the strategic intent and identify the outcomes required to achieve this intent. This phase defines the vision, objectives, and potential benefits expected to make sure they're aligned to an organisation's strategic drivers. These defined benefits help justify the expected time, resources, and effort needed to deliver the expected benefits. The more specific you are at this point will make the other process steps easier to capture and complete.  
- Plan and measure:  
Create a plan which further develops the findings from the first phase. It includes additional details such as the owner, the target you want to hit, and the data you'll be using to measure progress. It also includes the necessary arrangements that'll need to be in place to realise the benefits, like benefits ownership and governance. This phase will also prioritise the benefits and the business change. Ensure the measurements are clear and easily captured. If they are not, try breaking them down into smaller measurements.  
- Manage and report:  
Realising the benefits is only achieved by monitoring your progress towards the planned outcomes. If things don't go as planned, you can make an early assessment and put an appropriate corrective action in motion. Reference the business case while doing this, as there may be differences between what was initially proposed and what is attainable as the program progresses. This phase will help you measure, analyse, and understand the program outcomes. With this sort of intelligence, you're able to proactively support delivery of the benefits.  
- Continuous improvement:  
The adoption of change needs to be monitored and adjusted so that your organisation can fully achieve its benefits goals. During this phase, you'll document the benefit outcomes and learnings to inform strategic decisions and priorities moving forward. As you mature in the executing of the processes, identifying what is working well and what needs to improve ensures your focus in achieving benefits realisation is the most efficient and accurate way possible.

### Business Benefit Principles  
Core ingredients of the process - need to be included every time.  
**Benefits** - what organisations use to justify starting or rejecting a new project.  
Fundamental principles assist the organisation in making and managing their investment and resource decisions.  
1. Executive sponsorship and governance:  
These own and are accountable for delivering the benefit outcomes on behalf of the organisation. Active and visible executive sponsorship is the single most critical factor influencing the success of any benefits realisation. **Effective communication sponsorship** provides the focus, the commitment the allocation of organisation resources and the ability to remain focused on achieving the organisation's expected outcomes.  
Most executive sponsor's outcomes also align to their own personal key performance indicators and performance measures. Factoring this into your plans insures their ongoing commitment throughout the life of the project and the operational delivery after your project ends.  
Executive sponsors also oversee formal **governance**: The policies, procedures and business rules that the project team adhere to.  

2. Culture shift:  
These are the new mindsets, behaviors and beliefs required, from the change as many project changes include a level of cultural change which needs to be planned.  
These cultural shifts are equal, as important if not more so, than any process, technology or resourcing changes. Engagement and participation by a wide cross-section of employees needs to be considered across all levels - people need to feel like they can mae effective contributions.  

3. Deliver value:  
The focus on delivering value to the organisation ensures solutions will be clearly linked and traced to business outcomes - important for a project to keep this in mind relative to scope quality, cost to benefit ratio, and schedule.  
Keep in the mind the evolving operating model which must effectively support changes in the business strategy together with the demands driven by new opportunities to fulfill the organisation's mission and better serve the stakeholders.  

4. Structure:  
Focus on leveraging successful delivery methods that integrate with the organisation's financial, program and change management frameworks.  
ADKAR (**A**wareness **D**esire **K**nowledge **A**bility **R**einforcement)  
Frequent and open communication to facilitate the change effort. A communications plan helps define the internal and external communications strategy including purpose outcomes audience channels and key messaging.  

5. Collaborative change:  
This facilitates the tactical changes necessary to remove roadblocks, and enable continuous change.  

6. Continuous improvement:  
At each stage, feedback about the change and the benefits must be successfully incorporated into the next wave of changes. Often, this can be achieved through lessons learned at workshops at critical points throughout the program.  

### Business Benefit Artefacts  
Getting all the information up front - so you have all the answers when the stakeholders ask you questions.  

**Business Benefits Roadmap**:  
Benefits on a page - it articulates the linkage between the strategic outcomes, portfolio, program, and the project. It provides business benefits value which then acts as an input into the business case or business justification. The Roadmap outlines a framework to work through to make sure you're going in the right benefits direction.  

**Business Benefit Realisation Plan**:  
The what, why, by whom, how, and when of the benefits - created at the prgram planning level and refined firther for individual projects.  
Puts all business benefits realisation information into an action plan so that the project sponsor can check to see if the project is achieving what it set out ot achieve.  

**Benefits Measurement Performance Register**:  
Collectively report the benefits and view them all in one place - give the organisation an ongoing record that reports the progress of the benefits.  
Also gives a clear one page indication of where the organisation is in terms of realising the benefits spelled out in the Realisation Plan.  

The Business Benefit Roadmap sets out why you are going on the journey in the context of what has to occur to reach your destination. The Benefits Realisation Plan fills in more detail of how exactly you'll get there and what logistics are needed to support the Roadmap. The Benefits Measurement Performance Register is how you confirm and communicate you're on track. It also gives you and your sponsor visibility of the benefits so you can adjust them if you need to.  

### Why Business Benefits Measurement makes a difference  
With this information you are better positioned to achieve expected outcomes and it shows the sponsor and decision makers that their investment is sound.  
Benefits are dynamic and need to be continually measured throughout the lifecycle. As a result, benefits measurement, accountability, and reporting are key to the cultural shift, including continuous improvement to realise benefits.  
Benefits need to be as specific as possible:  
Are you measuring the right things?  
Are these measurements clearly associated to the strategic outcome?  
Will it be noticeable to a customer, employee, stakeholder, the service desk, to the public in the annual report, etc.  
When and how will we know the benefits will be realised?  
Use SMART to measure these benefits.  
Avoid generic language such as; improved, enhanced, aligned, optimised, or made better.  
Use specific, emasurable terms such as; eliminated, decreased, increased, created, or maintained.  

Make sure you measure negative outcomes as well (disbenefits) - new operational costs, loss of green space, job losses, more staff needed etc.  
It is important to note that one stakeholders benefit - job cuts (saving money) might be another's disbenefit - job loss or team reduction (redundancy, morale)

Do not confuse disbenefits with risks - risks can be avoided but disbenefits will be created by the required changes. The BA's job is to manage their impact - so it's important to know which stakeholders will lose out.  

## Creating a Business Benefits Roadmap  
### Business Benefits Roadmap Explained  
A benefits roadmap is a high-level picture or diagram of what needs to be done across the life of a project. It can also show interrelated projects that make up the program of work with the whole thing showing how it leads to business benefits. 

Roadmap Benfits:  
- Ensure rigour on understanding of benefits  
- Get stakeholders on the same page  
- Set the stage for change management  
- Provide information for investment decisions  
- Provide linkage between program and project acitivites  
- Carify benefits that can be expected  

Captures which programs need to be prioritised and approved.  

Key things to capture on the map:  
- The relationship between the program and outputs  
- Business changes needed to take on the new capabilities  
- Expected outcomes for the success of those business changes  
- Anticipated benefits to be realised as a result of those outcomes  
- Strategic objectives that will be achieved as a result  

Created prior to a business case and before a project is approved.  

### Steps to create the Business Benefits Roadmap  
Single page:  
It describes the "what" and shows the linkage to the "why" and "how". NOTE: This is different to the benefits realisation plan, which provides the summary of the "what" and "why" and explains in more detail how the benefits will be realized, by whom, and when.  

Identify and validate expected strategic outcomes through facilitated workshops - think about what will be maintained, eliminated, decreased, increased, or created to achieve the program or project outcomes. Think about the benefits that could be measured, as well as the organisational changes that will be required and supported to realise and manage the benefits.  

Start with the end in mind  
List the emasureable benefits  
Work backward from the outcomes or forward from a project - make the connection between what has to change in order to achieve those outcomes.  
List the assumptions and conditions that are required in order to achieve each of the outcomes and outputs.  

### Tricks to populate a great Business Benefits Roadmap  
Common mistakes:  
1. not getting the right level of engagement from senior stakeholders. Take time to understand the business need, and strategic outcomes, that are drivers in the project - collect facts to make them real for the relevant stakeholders.  
2. not clearly articulating the definitions and descriptors of outcomes, outputs, and assumptions. Don't allow for sweeping statements of benefits - be robust in your research.  
3. don't allow stakeholders to spend too much time on the solution or the detail. Make sure you align the required outcomes of the project with the organistaion's strategic objectives.  
4. inability to adjust the benefit as it evolves. Be ready when new information becomes available and make decisions based on the benefits measure.  
5. not testing the roadmap by discussing and validating the current business problem. Ask - What has to change to the project and operations? What has to stop? And if the benefit is realised, will it make a big difference?  
6. poorly defined strategy. If stakeholders can't clearly articulate the strategy  then they'll struggle to be clear on the benefits. Encourage them to discuss the strategic outcome and have them sign off on the benefits.

## Creating a Business Benefits Realisation Plan  
### Business Benefits Realisation Plan Explained  
Having a living document that's referred to beyond the project life-cycle to ensure that your project really does achieve what it set out to achieve.  
Articulates the expected outcomes of your project.  
1. Benefits themselves - financial? holistic? disbenefits?  
Make benefits SMART.  
Get senior stakehodlers to develop and own the benefits early.  
2. How they will be measured - analyse baseline data.  
RACI chart for the measurement and reporting process.  

### How to create a Business Benefits Realisation Plan  
Creating a document that can be referenced to, even beyond the project, ensures that your project really does achieve what it's set out to achieve.  
Chunk it into manageable pieces:  
1. Understand the program of work and associated benefits - work with senior stakeholders who have a stake in the realization of the benefits.  
2. Prioritise the benefits - Has the baseline or as is point been agreed with your key stakeholders so you know your starting point? Has the benefit owner or owners been consulted? Have benefit profiles and specifics and measurable targets been developed and agreed?  
3. Put the right emtrics in teh plan - show why the project is important and why the improvements recommended align with the organisation's plan.  
4. Carve out evaluation steps around the benefits - How will the benefits owner know how and when to report against the progress made? How will lessons learnt be captured and communicated?

### Populate the Performance Measurement Matrix  
The register should include a Benefits Description, and a Unique Identification Number, so the benefit can be referenced for traceability purposes, to business requirements, and solutions.  
Include the Benefit and Validation Owner, with their name, or position title.  
Include the Baseline and Date, the Target Value, current measures, and the anticipated End Benefit End Date.  
Include periodic checkpoints throughout the different stages of the project, for assurance, refinement, and validation.  

### Common challenges with Business Benefits Realisation Plan  
Ill defined benefits - avoid vagueties (bigger, faster, better)  
Lack of focus - something and then another thing  
Poor data - no organisational data or too spread out  
Unclear benefits ownership - owner isn't interested or lacks authority  

## Making the Process Work  
### Risk Management Planning  
1. the org does not have a sponsor or champion to be the owner of the nusiness benefits realisation  
2. planned benefits are not realised  
3. documented benefits are realised but eh customer is not satisfied  
4. documented benefits are realised but company personel perception is negative  
5. some benefits are realised but they are not the critical benefits

### Governance Requirements  
1. Measurements during a change initiative  
2. Measurements after your change is in place  
3. Governance meetings  
4. Reporting  

Check you are successfully collecting data to support your change  
Measure the degree of consistency that exists about what "better" looks like for your subjective business benefits  
Create measures to ensure you understand that your change initiative actually satisfies what your customers want  
Evaluate to ensure your business benefit needs remain valid as your change initiative progresses  

Measurements need to directly support the desired benefit with objective data, such as increased profit, increased productivity, reduced cost, or improved customer satisfaction as determined from customer surveys.  
Measurements should be easy to collect. If a measurement costs a lot to collect, the value of the information that it produces should be evaluated against the insights it provides.  
Measurements should be universally understood by your management team. If your managers do not have a common view of what the measurement is trying to confirm, it needs to be restructured.  
Good governance requires frequent meetings focused on the evaluation of the measurements and the information they provide. Appropriate, well-positioned managers with the ability to share views openly and change direction when needed are fundamental aspects of good benefits governance meetings.  
Good benefits governance process has good reporting of the business benefits, including the progress made and/or lessons learnt.  

### Monitor Business Benefits  
1. Business benefit definition and analysis. Define the benefit and confirm the benefit is built with proper consideration for all areas of your business. The definition and analysis stage identifies these impacts, both positive and negative, and ensures a pathway forward is defined for all affected areas of your business.  
2. Solution and design. During this lifecycle stage, the approaches, processes and/or technology solutions are designed to meet the business benefit defined in the first lifecycle stage.  This stage defines how each business benefit will be achieved. Monitoring of the viability of the proposed solution is then conducted.  
3. Evaluation of the organisational change management implications for each of your business benefits. New business benefits potentially bring about changes to processes, power shifts between departments, new roles and changed roles in your organisation. Each of these need to be defined and monitored.  
4. Process and user acceptance testing. The solutions defined and drafted need to be reviewed, understood and confirmed by all affected areas of your business. Key staff members of management both need to be in the loop at this stage. This acceptance testing is performed by walking through each step of a new process and/or testing all of the components of a new technology solution. Any errors or failures to achieve the intended business benefits could be examined carefully, changed and reevaluated until a desirable outcome is achieved.  
5. Training and post-implementation reviews. This lifecycle stage occurs immediately before and after your change is implemented for your business to use. Every person who needs to alter their approach to work needs to be trained so they can understand what is expected of them to achieve the new business benefits. After the changes are put in place, you and your management team should carefully examine what is happening with each of these changes and determine whether or not the intended business benefits are being realised.  
6. Oerational quarterly reviews after your new benefit-producing processes have been embedded in your organisation. These ensure that old work habits have not been reintroduced into your organisation and that your business benefits are withstanding the test of time.  

### Report Results  
First, report on results frequently, and utilise specific measurement criteria for each business benefit you are tracking.  
Next, share the health or status of benefits in any initiative or project status reports. These status reports should also include, risk status tracking for anything that can affect the realisation of your business benefit.  
Next, have a centralised method for reporting the status of business benefits for your entire organisation.  
Next, provide updates on your business's readiness for change. Readiness for change can include, the completeness of new business processes, the percentage of staff members that have received the appropriate training, or, the status of the change management implementation, including definition of the new roles, and the identification of staff members to fulfill those roles.  

What do you do if you have a large initiative with multiple or very substantial changes occurring over a longer period of time? - create a schedule:  

A business benefit realisation schedule is a sequential list of when the business benefit will be installed, who will be affected by any business process changes, and when the new measurements and targets for each business benefit should be expected by your management team.
