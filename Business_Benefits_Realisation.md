## Understanding Business Benefits  
### Roles in Business Benefits Realisation  
Benefits management begins by defining the portfolio, program, and project objectives and how they align to the organisation's strategic objectives and expected benefits.  
Portfolio Management refers to the centralised management of all the projects being undertaken to achieve the strategic objectives of the organisation.  
Program Management refers to bringing a number of projects together under one program of work.  
Change Management roles are found across the portfolio: portfolio manager, program manager, project manager, business analyst, or the organisational change manager each play a role in determining what the benefits are, the measurements that are needed, and ultimately how the organisation achieves against that strategic objectives.  

### Purpose and Intent of Business Benefits Realisation  
Executives make decisions based on the potential benefits. Once a project is approved, those measurable outcomes and benefits need to be achieved.  
**Five Objectives:**  
- Be specific - Ensure benefits are clearly identified, defind and linked to the strategic outcomes.  
- Clearly define ownership - Ensure business areas are committed to realising their defined benefits and the ownership of the benefits is spelled out including responsibility for adding value through the realisation process.  
- Define the process - Drive the process of realising benefits, including benefit measurement, tracking, and recording benefits as they are realised.  
- Create a plan - Use the defined, expected benefits as a roadmap for the program, providing a focus for delivering change.  
- Ensure benefits are traceable - Provide alignment and clear links between the program vision and desired benefits together with the organisation's strategic objectives.  

Benefits are part of a lifecycle: From strategy, through tactical, to operational.  

### Business Benefits Framework Pillars  
For porjects of all sizes the framwork will assist the organisation to work out what the benefits will be, and how they can be measured, and managed through to realisation.  
The four pillars of the business benefits framework offer the rigour and consistency that is needed to enable and ensure each of the individual projects, then grouped into programs, will deliver the benefit outcomes expected at the portfolio level. The four pillars also provide organisational structure, to enable collection of data in a consistent and standardised way, for reporting at the portfolio level.  

**Four Pillars:**  
- Standards:  
Documented, consistent standards that articulate who is interested in the benefits. It assists stakeholders to transition and define their specific needs. It helps inform their decision making. And it's also a part of the continuous improvement process at the portfolio and program levels.  
- Best Practices:  
Applying this intelligence across an organisation or multiple organisations. Benefits are often realised as a result of multiple projects. The realisation process can also be impacted as the organisation evolves and the business adopts the change.  
- Terms & Categories:  
You need a glossary of terms to ensure that everyone is using the same language and achieving the same meaning. Every organisation will have different benefit types and categories, but they always include these three:  
1. financial. Also known as tangible. These are benefits that can be quantified, and valued in financial terms. For example, cost savings and revenue generation.  
2. nonfinancial. They are benefits that can be quantified but are difficult to value in financial terms. For example, improved resilience.  
3. intangible benefits. These are benefits that can be identified but cannot be easily quantified. For example, end user satisfaction, better access to information, or improved customer service.  
- Guidance:  
Guidance the portfolio, program, and project sponsors, and benefit owners.  

### Business Benefits Framework Process  
Organisations are constantly striving for consistency in the way they execute to enable efficient, accurate, and replicable techniques to achieving outcomes.  
Pillars provide structure and needs a consistent process to enable alignment across the projects, programs, and portfolio benefits.  
**Four Step Process:**  
- Define the benefits:  
Establish the strategic intent and identify the outcomes required to achieve this intent. This phase defines the vision, objectives, and potential benefits expected to make sure they're aligned to an organisation's strategic drivers. These defined benefits help justify the expected time, resources, and effort needed to deliver the expected benefits. The more specific you are at this point will make the other process steps easier to capture and complete.  
- Plan and measure:  
Create a plan which further develops the findings from the first phase. It includes additional details such as the owner, the target you want to hit, and the data you'll be using to measure progress. It also includes the necessary arrangements that'll need to be in place to realise the benefits, like benefits ownership and governance. This phase will also prioritise the benefits and the business change. Ensure the measurements are clear and easily captured. If they are not, try breaking them down into smaller measurements.  
- Manage and report:  
Realising the benefits is only achieved by monitoring your progress towards the planned outcomes. If things don't go as planned, you can make an early assessment and put an appropriate corrective action in motion. Reference the business case while doing this, as there may be differences between what was initially proposed and what is attainable as the program progresses. This phase will help you measure, analyse, and understand the program outcomes. With this sort of intelligence, you're able to proactively support delivery of the benefits.  
- Continuous improvement:  
The adoption of change needs to be monitored and adjusted so that your organisation can fully achieve its benefits goals. During this phase, you'll document the benefit outcomes and learnings to inform strategic decisions and priorities moving forward. As you mature in the executing of the processes, identifying what is working well and what needs to improve ensures your focus in achieving benefits realisation is the most efficient and accurate way possible.

### Business Benefit Principles  
Core ingredients of the process - need to be included every time.  
**Benefits** - what organisations use to justify starting or rejecting a new project.  
Fundamental principles assist the organisation in making and managing their investment and resource decisions.  
1. Executive sponsorship and governance:  
These own and are accountable for delivering the benefit outcomes on behalf of the organisation. Active and visible executive sponsorship is the single most critical factor influencing the success of any benefits realisation. **Effective communication sponsorship** provides the focus, the commitment the allocation of organisation resources and the ability to remain focused on achieving the organisation's expected outcomes.  
Most executive sponsor's outcomes also align to their own personal key performance indicators and performance measures. Factoring this into your plans insures their ongoing commitment throughout the life of the project and the operational delivery after your project ends.  
Executive sponsors also oversee formal **governance**: The policies, procedures and business rules that the project team adhere to.  

2. Culture shift:  
These are the new mindsets, behaviors and beliefs required, from the change as many project changes include a level of cultural change which needs to be planned.  
These cultural shifts are equal, as important if not more so, than any process, technology or resourcing changes. Engagement and participation by a wide cross-section of employees needs to be considered across all levels - people need to feel like they can mae effective contributions.  

3. Deliver value:  
The focus on delivering value to the organisation ensures solutions will be clearly linked and traced to business outcomes - important for a project to keep this in mind relative to scope quality, cost to benefit ratio, and schedule.  
Keep in the mind the evolving operating model which must effectively support changes in the business strategy together with the demands driven by new opportunities to fulfill the organisation's mission and better serve the stakeholders.  

4. Structure:  
Focus on leveraging successful delivery methods that integrate with the organisation's financial, program and change management frameworks.  
ADKAR (**A**wareness **D**esire **K**nowledge **A**bility **R**einforcement)  
Frequent and open communication to facilitate the change effort. A communications plan helps define the internal and external communications strategy including purpose outcomes audience channels and key messaging.  

5. Collaborative change:  
This facilitates the tactical changes necessary to remove roadblocks, and enable continuous change.  

6. Continuous improvement:  
At each stage, feedback about the change and the benefits must be successfully incorporated into the next wave of changes. Often, this can be achieved through lessons learned at workshops at critical points throughout the program.  

### Business Benefit Artefacts  
Getting all the information up front - so you have all the answers when the stakeholders ask you questions.  

**Business Benefits Roadmap**:  
Benefits on a page - it articulates the linkage between the strategic outcomes, portfolio, program, and the project. It provides business benefits value which then acts as an input into the business case or business justification. The Roadmap outlines a framework to work through to make sure you're going in the right benefits direction.  

**Business Benefit Realisation Plan**:  
The what, why, by whom, how, and when of the benefits - created at the prgram planning level and refined firther for individual projects.  
Puts all business benefits realisation information into an action plan so that the project sponsor can check to see if the project is achieving what it set out ot achieve.  

**Benefits Measurement Performance Register**:  
Collectively report the benefits and view them all in one place - give the organisation an ongoing record that reports the progress of the benefits.  
Also gives a clear one page indication of where the organisation is in terms of realising the benefits spelled out in the Realisation Plan.  

The Business Benefit Roadmap sets out why you are going on the journey in the context of what has to occur to reach your destination. The Benefits Realisation Plan fills in more detail of how exactly you'll get there and what logistics are needed to support the Roadmap. The Benefits Measurement Performance Register is how you confirm and communicate you're on track. It also gives you and your sponsor visibility of the benefits so you can adjust them if you need to.  

### Why Business Benefits Measurement makes a difference  
With this information you are better positioned to achieve expected outcomes and it shows the sponsor and decision makers that their investment is sound.  
Benefits are dynamic and need to be continually measured throughout the lifecycle. As a result, benefits measurement, accountability, and reporting are key to the cultural shift, including continuous improvement to realise benefits.  
Benefits need to be as specific as possible:  
Are you measuring the right things?  
Are these measurements clearly associated to the strategic outcome?  
Will it be noticeable to a customer, employee, stakeholder, the service desk, to the public in the annual report, etc.  
When and how will we know the benefits will be realised?  
Use SMART to measure these benefits.  
Avoid generic language such as; improved, enhanced, aligned, optimised, or made better.  
Use specific, emasurable terms such as; eliminated, decreased, increased, created, or maintained.  

Make sure you measure negative outcomes as well (disbenefits) - new operational costs, loss of green space, job losses, more staff needed etc.  
It is important to note that one stakeholders benefit - job cuts (saving money) might be another's disbenefit - job loss or team reduction (redundancy, morale)

Do not confuse disbenefits with risks - risks can be avoided but disbenefits will be created by the required changes. The BA's job is to manage their impact - so it's important to know which stakeholders will lose out.
